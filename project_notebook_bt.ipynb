693\n","[('uksc-2009-0034.txt', \"Part III of the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984 was enacted to give the English court the power to grant financial relief after a marriage had been dissolved (or annulled) in a foreign country.\\nThis appeal raises for the first time at this appellate level the proper approach to the operation of Part III of the 1984 Act.\\nMr and Mrs Agbaje (the husband and the wife) were married for 38 years prior to their divorce in 2005 on the husbands petition in Nigeria.\\nThey were born in Nigeria, but both have British and Nigerian citizenship.\\nAll five children of the family were born in England.\\nThe wife has been living in England continuously since 1999, when the marriage broke down.\\nThe assets are about 700,000, of which 530,000 represents two houses in London in the husbands name, and the balance represents properties in Nigeria.\\nThe Nigerian court awarded the wife a life interest in a property in Lagos (which, as found by the Nigerian court, had a capital value of about 86,000) and a lump sum which was the equivalent of about 21,000.\\nMunby J acceded to an ex parte application by the wife for leave to make an application under Part III, and confirmed his decision on the husbands application to set it aside.\\nOn the substantive hearing Coleridge J made an order which was intended to enable the wife to house and maintain herself in London by providing her with 65% of the proceeds of sale (expected to be about 275,000) of the house in which she has been living.\\nHis order is the equivalent of a 39% award to the wife.\\nThe Court of Appeal (Ward, Longmore and Jackson LJJ) allowed the husbands appeal, principally on the ground that the judge had given insufficient weight to the connections of the case with Nigeria: [2009] EWCA Civ 1, [2009] 3 WLR 835.\\nAn Appeal Committee of the House of Lords granted leave to appeal from that decision.\\nMatrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984, Part III\\nThe background to Part III of the 1984 Act\\nThe background to Part III was concern at the hardship to wives and children caused by the effect of a combination of the liberality of the rules relating to recognition of foreign divorces and the restrictive approach of some foreign jurisdictions to financial provision.\\nThe problem became apparent in a series of cases in the 1970s in which there had been a foreign divorce in proceedings (both judicial and extra judicial) instituted by the husband in which no financial provision had been made for the wife.\\nIn those cases the divorce was entitled to recognition in England, e.g. because of a real and substantial connection with the foreign country (under the rule in Indyka v Indyka [1969] 1 AC 33) or because of the husbands citizenship of that country (Recognition of Divorces and Legal Separations Act 1971, now the Family Law Act 1986).\\nAs a result the parties were regarded as no longer married, and the court was not able to make an order in her favour for financial relief: Turczak v Turczak [1970] P 198, in which it was held that, following a Polish divorce, there was no power to order maintenance under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1965 because the parties were no longer husband and wife; Torok v Torok [1973] 1 WLR 1066, in which Ormrod J drew attention to the fact that, if a divorce were obtained in Hungary on the basis of the husbands Hungarian nationality, it would have to be recognised, and the English court would have no jurisdiction under the Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act 1970 to deal with the house in England where the wife and children were living, even though the Hungarian court was unlikely to award maintenance.\\nAs a result of these cases there were calls for legislation to give the English court jurisdiction to grant ancillary relief after a foreign divorce: e.g. Karsten (1970) 33 MLR 205 and (1972) 35 MLR 299; Pearl [1974] CLJ 77.\\nIn Quazi v Quazi [1980] AC 744, which was decided in 1979, the husband had pronounced a talaq in Pakistan.\\nThe question was whether the English court had jurisdiction on the wifes petition to dissolve the marriage and make consequential orders relating to a house in Wimbledon in which the wife was living with their son and which belonged to the husband, and to make provision for their financial support.\\nIt was held by the House of Lords that the talaq was to be recognised under the 1971 Act.\\nConsequently there was no subsisting marriage and no power in the English court to make financial provision.\\nIn the Court of Appeal Ormrod LJ (as he had become) drew attention to the urgent need for attention by Parliament to deal with the problem.\\nIn the House of Lords Lord Scarman agreed (at 819) that there was need for reform, and expressed the hope that the matter would be referred to the Law Commissions.\\nThe matter was then referred to the Law Commissions.\\nIn 1980 the Law Commission for England and Wales published a Working Paper on Financial Relief after Foreign Divorce (Working Paper No 77 (1980)), which was supplemented by a Scottish Law Commission Consultation Paper in 1981.\\nBoth Commissions published Reports in 1982: Law Com No 117 and Scot Law Com No 72.\\nThe Law Commissions recommended that the law be reformed to allow financial provision to be ordered after a foreign divorce not only in cases where no financial provision had been made, or could have been made, in the country where the divorce was granted, but also where the provision was inadequate.\\nThe Law Commission for England and Wales also recommended a filter mechanism requiring leave of the court to make an application to the English court.\\nPart III of the 1984 Act\\nAs a result of the work of the Law Commissions, Part III (applying to England and Wales) and Part IV (applying to Scotland) of the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984 were enacted.\\nThe law in Northern Ireland is equivalent to Part III of the 1984 Act: SI 1989 No 677 (NI 4).\\nThere are significant differences between Part III and Part IV, to which it will be necessary to revert.\\nPart III applies to annulment and judicial separation as well as to divorce, but for ease of exposition only divorce will be referred to in this account.\\nBy section 12, where a marriage has been dissolved, by means of judicial or other proceedings in an overseas country, and the divorce is entitled to be recognised as valid in England and Wales, either party to the marriage may apply to the court in the manner prescribed by rules of court for an order for financial relief under Part III.\\nA filter mechanism is established by section 13: (1) No application for an order for financial relief shall be made under this Part of this Act unless the leave of the court has been obtained in accordance with rules of court; and the court shall not grant leave unless it considers that there is substantial ground for the making of an application for such an order. (2) The court may grant leave under this section notwithstanding that an order has been made by a court in a country outside England and Wales requiring the other party to the marriage to make any payment or transfer any property to the applicant or a child of the family. (3) Leave under this section may be granted subject to such conditions as the court thinks fit.\\nSection 15(1) sets out the jurisdictional requirements: (a) domicile in England and Wales of either of the parties on the date of the application for financial provision or on the date when the divorce in the foreign country took effect; or (b) habitual residence of either of the parties for one year ending on the date of the application or the foreign divorce; or (c) a beneficial interest by either or both, at the date of the application, in a dwelling house in England and Wales which was at some time during the marriage used as a matrimonial home.\\nSection 16 provides: the connection which the parties to the marriage have with (1) Before making an order for financial relief the court shall consider whether in all the circumstances of the case it would be appropriate for such an order to be made by a court in England and Wales, and if the court is not satisfied that it would be appropriate, the court shall dismiss the application. (2) The court shall in particular have regard to the following matters (a) England and Wales; (b) the connection which those parties have with the country in which the marriage was dissolved or annulled or in which they were legally separated; (c) country outside England and Wales; (d) any financial benefit which the applicant or a child of the family has received, or is likely to receive, in consequence of the divorce, annulment or legal separation, by virtue of any agreement or the operation of the law of a country outside England and Wales; in a case where an order has been made by a court in a (e) country outside England and Wales requiring the other party to the marriage to make any payment or transfer any property for the benefit of the applicant or a child of the family, the financial relief given by the order and the extent to which the order has been complied with or is likely to be complied with; the connection which those parties have with any other (f) any right which the applicant has, or has had, to apply for financial relief from the other party to the marriage under the law of any country outside England and Wales and if the applicant has omitted to exercise that right the reason for that omission; the availability in England and Wales of any property in (g) respect of which an order under this Part of this Act in favour of the applicant could be made; (h) is likely to be enforceable; (i) divorce, annulment or legal separation. the length of time which has elapsed since the date of the\\nthe extent to which any order made under this Part of this Act\\nOn the substantive hearing the court is given power by section 17 to make (inter alia) the orders in sections 23 (financial provision orders) and 24 (property adjustment orders) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, and pension sharing orders within the meaning of Part I of the 1973 Act.\\nThe powers of the court to make orders are more restrictive where jurisdiction depends on the matrimonial home having been in England and Wales: section 20.\\nIn deciding whether to apply its powers under section 17, and, if so, in what manner, the court must (by section 18) have regard, so far as material to this appeal, to three matters.\\nFirst, the court is to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, first consideration being given to the welfare while a minor of any child of the family who has not attained the age of eighteen (section 18(2)).\\nSecond, as regards the exercise of those powers in relation to a party to the marriage, the court is to have regard to the matters mentioned in section 25(2)(a) (h) of the 1973 Act (section 18(3)).\\nThird, where a foreign court has made an order for payments or the transfer of property by a party to the marriage, in considering the financial resources of the other party to the marriage, the court is to have regard to the extent to which that order has been, or is likely to be, complied with (section 18(6)).\\nSection 18(2) of the 1984 Act is in the same terms as section 25(1) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, which also directs attention to all the circumstances of the case, and section 25(2) of the 1973 Act contains the familiar list of factors to be taken into account in the exercise of the statutory discretion, which is designed to achieve a fair outcome: White v White [2001] 1 AC 596; McFarlane v McFarlane [2006] UKHL 24, [2006] 2 AC 618.\\nThe facts\\nThe husband is aged 71, and is a barrister in Nigeria.\\nHe lives in Lagos.\\nThe wife is aged 68.\\nShe lives in a house in Lytton Road, New Barnet, Hertfordshire (the Lytton Road property) which is in the husbands sole name.\\nShe undertakes occasional work as a carer, and is in receipt of a basic state pension supplemented by pension credit as well as a small Nigerian occupational pension.\\nBoth parties were born in Nigeria.\\nIn the 1960s each of them came to England to live.\\nThe husband came in 1961 to read for the Bar, and the wife came in 1962 to study and work.\\nThey met in December 1965 and were married in London in May 1967.\\nThere were five children of the family, the eldest born to the wife in 1965 shortly before she had met the husband and four children of the marriage, born in 1967, 1969, 1973 and 1980.\\nAll the children were born in England.\\nIn 1972 the parties acquired United Kingdom citizenship and each now has dual British and Nigerian nationality.\\nIn September 1973 the husband returned to Nigeria to qualify there and to set up a legal practice.\\nIn May 1974 the wife and the children joined the husband in Nigeria, but all the children were educated in England except the youngest.\\nIn November 1975 the husband purchased the Lytton Road property.\\nThe wife says that it was a matrimonial home, and the husband says that it was purchased for the purpose of providing a home for the children (and their nanny) when they were in England.\\nBetween 1978 and 1982 the family lived at 76 Ijeshatado Road, Lagos, and from 1982 to 1999 at Plot 2, Tin Can Island, Lagos (Tin Can Island).\\nIn 1999, the parties separated after 32 years of marriage.\\nThe wife moved to England and settled at the Lytton Road property, where she has since lived.\\nThe husband remained in Nigeria although he purchased an investment property in Windmill Drive, NW2 (the Windmill Drive property) in 2002 which he says (and which the Nigerian court accepted) was bought for the youngest child.\\nThe husband issued divorce proceedings in the High Court of Lagos on June 4, 2003.\\nThe wifes case was that, although she knew that the husband had initiated divorce proceedings in Nigeria, she did not receive a copy of the husbands petition until December 10, 2003.\\nShe issued her divorce petition on December 8, 2003 in Barnet County Court based on her habitual residence in England and Wales for at least one year.\\nOn February 24, 2004, the wife filed an answer and cross petition in the Lagos proceedings seeking ancillary relief, including a claim that Tin Can Island and the Lytton Road property (and subsequently the Windmill Drive property) be settled on her.\\nThe wife also sought two cars, and a lump sum of 10 million naira (about 42,000) as a maintenance allowance for her during her lifetime.\\nThe husband made an application in England for a stay of the wifes divorce proceedings.\\nThe wife made an application in Lagos for a stay of the Lagos proceedings, and also applied in England for an anti suit injunction restraining the Lagos proceedings.\\nIn November 2004 Ryder J dismissed the wifes application for an anti suit injunction, but he envisaged that she might apply in England for an order under Part III of the 1984 Act.\\nThe husbands application for a stay was adjourned pending the wifes application for a stay in the Lagos proceedings.\\nIn the course of those proceedings, the wife sought to withdraw her claim for ancillary relief and gave evidence that she wanted her ancillary relief claims to be determined in London.\\nOn June 2, 2005 the judge in Nigeria, Nicol Clay J, granted a decree nisi on the husbands petition (based on three years separation), and dismissed the wifes cross petition.\\nThe judge refused the wifes request that her ancillary relief claims should be determined in London.\\nShe ordered that Tin Can Island, the former matrimonial home, be settled on the wife for life (as the husband had agreed) under the Nigerian Matrimonial Causes Act 1990, section 72(1).\\nThat section gives the court power to require the parties to make such a settlement of property to which the parties are, or either of them is, entitled, as the court considers just and equitable; but it does not give power to the court to order an outright transfer.\\nShe also ordered the husband to make a payment of a lump sum of 5 million naira (about 21,000) as maintenance for life.\\nThe judge dismissed the wifes claims in respect of the London properties (and a Nigerian property) on the basis that she had failed to prove any financial contribution towards their purchase.\\nDecree absolute was granted by the High Court of Lagos on September 2, 2005.\\nThe application for leave\\nIt is necessary to set the course of the application for leave out in some detail for two reasons.\\nThe first reason is that the Court of Appeal was critical of Coleridge J for his reliance on Munby Js judgment on the husbands application to set aside the order for leave.\\nThe second reason is that the enormous delay caused by the husbands application to set aside gives rise to considerable disquiet about the procedure in Part III proceedings.\\nAt the end of September 2005, the wife sought leave to apply for an order for financial relief pursuant to section 13(1) of Part III.\\nLeave was granted by Munby J at the end of November 2005: [2005] EWHC 3459 (Fam).\\nMunby J referred to the very considerable discrepancy between the aggregate value of what the English court would consider to be the relevant matrimonial assets and the actual provision to the wife, and concluded (at [7]): that that very significant discrepancy, and the very modest amount of the provision made for this wife following a marriage of that length in relation to a case where there appear to be significant assets, is such that, having regard, as I do, to each of the facts and matters set out in section 16(2) of the Act, there are established substantial grounds for making this application within the meaning of section 13(1).\\nIn February 2006, the wife issued her application for periodical payments, a property adjustment order in respect of the Lytton Road property, and a lump sum order.\\nAt the end of April 2006, the husband issued an application to set aside the grant of leave.\\nHe conceded that the court had jurisdiction to make an order under Part III on the basis of the wifes habitual residence in England.\\nIn July, 2006 Charles J ordered that the application be listed for a one day hearing fixed for November 17, 2006 before Munby J, and gave directions for the filing of evidence.\\nMunby J delivered a reserved judgment on December 18, 2006 in which he set out the facts and the law in the fullest detail over 28 single spaced pages: [2006] EWHC 3285 (Fam).\\nHe reaffirmed the views expressed in his judgment on the ex parte application about the effect of the significant discrepancy between the matrimonial assets and what the wife was awarded.\\nHe accepted that it was not necessary to make a finding of exceptional circumstances.\\nHe was satisfied that there were exceptional circumstances and that the wife would suffer hardship real hardship if leave were not given, being faced with the unenviable choice of either remaining homeless in England, where she was based and wanted to stay, or returning to Nigeria: [57] [60].\\nMunby J ordered that the application for relief be limited to (a) a periodical payments order; (b) a property adjustment order in relation to the Lytton Road property; and (c) a lump sum order.\\nLeave was made subject to a number of conditions pursuant to section 13(3), in particular that the principal findings of fact made by Nicol Clay J were to stand in the Part III proceedings; and that neither party was permitted to adduce valuation evidence of the Nigerian properties.\\nThe matter was further delayed until the question of costs was dealt with, and an order was not entered until March 16, 2007.\\nMunby J refused the husband permission to appeal.\\nThe husband applied to the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal on April 11, 2007.\\nHis application was refused on paper by Thorpe LJ, and on June 18, 2007 the husband renewed his application for permission before Wilson and Wall LJJ, who dismissed the application: [2007] EWCA Civ 681.\\nThe consequence was that the leave process took from September 2005 until June 2007 to be completed, and that the substantive hearing did not come on until April 2008.\\nThis is a shocking delay, to which has to be added the time taken in appeals to the Court of Appeal and this court.\\nAs indicated above, the filter mechanism for leave in section 13 was recommended by the Law Commission.\\nThe Working Paper suggested that the ground for leave be that in all the circumstances the case was a proper one to be heard, but it added (para 53, n 195) that the court would have an inherent power to deal with individual cases in the most convenient way, e.g. by adjourning an application for leave to enable evidence to be filed by the other side; and by dealing with applications for leave inter partes and (if leave is given) with the substantive matters at the same hearing.\\nThe Law Commission Report recommended that the filter should require the applicant to establish a substantial ground for the making of the application, and if necessary Rules of Court could specify the circumstances in which the respondent could object: para 2.3.\\nRule 3.17 of the Family Proceedings Rules provides for the ex parte application where leave is sought under Part III.\\nBut a subsequent application to set aside is not specifically provided for under the Rules, although it is of course a fundamental rule of procedure that the court may set aside the making an ex parte order on the application of the respondent.\\nConcern has been expressed at the delay caused by applications to set aside: see Jordan v Jordan [2000] 1 WLR 210, 222 per Thorpe LJ, and Munby J and Ward and Longmore LJJ in the present proceedings.\\nIt is clear that something must be done to prevent the waste of costs and court time, and prejudice to the applicant, caused by applications to set aside which have only questionable chances of success.\\nThat must of course be balanced by a proper application of the threshold of substantial ground.\\nBut as Deane J said in the Federal Court of Australia in an entirely different context, the word substantial is not only susceptible of ambiguity: it is a word calculated to conceal a lack of precision: Tillmanns Butcheries Pty Ltd v Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (1979) 42 FLR 331, 348.\\nIn the present context the principal object of the filter mechanism is to prevent wholly unmeritorious claims being pursued to oppress or blackmail a former spouse.\\nThe threshold is not high, but is higher than serious issue to be tried or good arguable case found in other contexts.\\nIt is perhaps best expressed by saying that in this context substantial means solid.\\nOnce a judge has given reasons for deciding at the ex parte stage that the threshold has been crossed, the approach to setting aside leave should be the same as the approach to setting aside permission to appeal in the Civil Procedure Rules, where (by contrast with the Family Proceedings Rules) there is an express power to set aside, but which may only be exercised where there is a compelling reason to do so: CPR r 52.9(2).\\nIn practice in the Court of Appeal the power is only exercised where some decisive authority has been overlooked so that the appeal is bound to fail, or where the court has been misled: Barings Bank plc v Coopers & Lybrand [2002] EWCA Civ 1155; Nathan v Smilovitch [2007] EWCA Civ 759.\\nIn an application under section 13, unless it is clear that the respondent can deliver a knock out blow, the court should use its case management powers to adjourn an application to set aside to be heard with the substantive application.\\nThe substantive hearing: Coleridge J and the Court of Appeal\\nThe matter came before Coleridge J on April 3 and 4, 2008 and he delivered an unreserved judgment.\\nHe relied on Munby Js second judgment for the chronology and the relevant law.\\nHe directed himself that he was unfettered by any hardship test, and if an order was appropriate the provision made after a foreign order should be the minimum required to overcome the injustice, i.e. not a complete re run of the proceedings as if these were domestic ancillary relief proceedings, relying on A v S (Financial Relief after Overseas US Divorce) [2003] 1 FLR 431 (Bodey J).\\nHe took into account the following matters in particular.\\nThe parties had a longstanding real connection with the United Kingdom, its culture and way of life.\\nIn particular they were British citizens, and all the children were British and were born in England.\\nThe wife had been resident in England for nearly 10 years, had strong connections there and would continue to make her main home there.\\nThe parties had bought two properties in England.\\nBut it was not an English ancillary relief case.\\nHe took into account, in particular, the length of the marriage and the needs of the wife.\\nHe ordered that the wife should receive a lump sum equal to 65% of the gross proceeds of sale of the Lytton Road property.\\nThis would be about 275,000 comprising 225,000 to meet her housing need and 50,000 to supplement her income and provide for her when she could not work.\\nAs a condition of the order, the wife agreed to relinquish her life interest in Tin Can Island.\\nThe award of 275,000 represented 39% of the total assets.\\nColeridge J refused the husbands application for permission to appeal, and on an application to the Court of Appeal for permission, Wilson LJ adjourned the application to be heard with appeal to follow if permission were granted.\\nThe Court of Appeal (Ward, Longmore and Jackson LJJ) gave permission to appeal and allowed the appeal: [2009] EWCA Civ 1, [2009] 3 WLR 835.\\nThe main judgment was given by Ward LJ.\\nThe principal elements of his reasoning were as follows.\\nThe true question was whether the foreign order provided an unjust result.\\nDisparity in potential awards was an obvious factor to which regard must be had, but it should not be permitted to dominate because (as he put it) London was perceived to be the divorce capital of the world.\\nThe focus should be on whether, objectively speaking, substantial justice or injustice was done overseas, a fortiori when the foreign court was the appropriate forum for granting the divorce and regulating the financial consequences of the dissolution.\\nColeridge J had not adequately referred to the parties connection with Nigeria.\\nHe had not addressed the need for respect and deference to be paid to the Nigerian court.\\nHe had not expressly addressed the factors in section 16(2)(d),(e) and (f) (the right to apply in Nigeria and the award in Nigeria).\\nIt was not enough to find that a serious injustice was done to the wife in Nigeria simply because there was no power to make a transfer of property order there, and it was not in accord with the purpose of section 16 for the English court to sit on appeal from the judgment of a foreign court, which was effectively what Coleridge J had done.\\nColeridge J had relied too much on Munby Js judgment.\\nHe had not explained why the case hinged on the parties connection with England, why the connection with Nigeria was not the more important factor, why the Nigerian proceedings did not command full deference for reasons of comity, why no substantial injustice was done to the wife in Nigeria and why justice would be done to the husband if, within months of the conclusion of those proceedings, he were to be forced to litigate the matters afresh in England notwithstanding the earlier acceptance by the courts of Nigeria as the appropriate forum for the resolution of the divorce and ancillary relief claims.\\nIn view of those matters the discretion was to be exercised afresh by the Court of Appeal.\\nThe parties had a more significant connection with Nigeria than with England, and Nigeria, not England, was the natural and appropriate forum for the resolution of the wifes claims.\\nNo substantial injustice was done to the wife in Nigeria notwithstanding the absence of a power to transfer the Tin Can Island property to her.\\nAlthough she would suffer real hardship in England, having exhausted the lump sum designed to provide for her sustenance in Nigeria (as she asked for it there), comity commanded respect for the overseas order and it would not be appropriate to grant her what Ward LJ described as even another nibble at the cherry.\\nThe appeal\\nThere is little difference between the approach of Coleridge J and the Court of Appeal, and this appeal could be disposed of simply by considering whether Coleridge J had taken the relevant factors into account and weighed them properly.\\nBut the approach of the judge and the Court of Appeal does raise a number of questions of principle which require attention before the question whether there were any grounds for interference with the exercise of discretion is addressed.\\nThose questions are these: (1) To what issue the matters listed in section 16(2) are directed. (2) What role (if any) forum non conveniens principles or comity have to play in the exercise of the discretion. (3) Whether the applicant must show exceptional circumstances, or hardship, or serious injustice, before an order can be made. (4) To what matters the court should have regard in deciding whether, and in what way, to exercise its powers under section 17, and in particular whether there is a principle that the court is limited to making an order which represents the minimum necessary to remedy the hardship or injustice.\\nThe relevance of the section 16(2) factors\\nMunby J [2006] EWHC 3285 (Fam), ([37]) and Coleridge J (at page 3 of his judgment), and the Court of Appeal (at [16]) considered that the question for determination in section 16 is whether it was appropriate for an order to be made.\\nThis is in error.\\nOn the substantive hearing Part III directs the court to two principal areas of fact or appreciation.\\nFirst, section 16(2) sets out matters to which the court must have regard for the purposes of section 16(1).\\nSecond, section 18(2) and (3) refer to the matters to which the court is to have regard in deciding whether to exercise the powers under section 17.\\nThe factors in section 16(2) are not expressed to be relevant to the question whether an order is to be made.\\nThey are the matters to which regard must be had in considering whether it would be appropriate for such an order to be made by a court in England and Wales (section 16(1)).\\nThere is no ambiguity in the language, and it is therefore not necessary to resort for confirmation to the sidenote to section 16 or the Law Commission Report.\\nThe sidenote is Duty of the court to consider whether England and Wales is appropriate venue for application.\\nThe Law Commissions explanatory note on the draft Bill included this on what became section 16: It is intended that it should be possible to raise the issue of appropriateness of the English court separately from, or together with, the matters relevant to the exercise of the courts discretion in deciding whether to exercise its powers and if so in what way (Report, page 29)\\nConsequently both Munby J and Coleridge J and the Court of Appeal, were in error to the extent that they treated section 16 itself as determining the criteria by which the question whether the order for financial provision was to be made.\\nThat question depends on the combined effect of sections 17 and 18, to which it will be necessary to revert.\\nThe error is not likely, however, to have any significant practical importance.\\nBy section 18(2) the court is to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, and several of the factors in section 16(2) will plainly be relevant to the question of whether an order is to be made, and, if so, what order: for example, the financial benefit which the applicant has received; or whether the applicant has failed to take advantage of a right under the foreign law to claim financial relief.\\nSo also because the list in section 16(2) is not exhaustive (The court shall in particular have regard ), matters which are not expressly referred to in section 16(2), such as hardship or injustice, may be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether it is appropriate that the English court should make an order, just as they can be taken into account under section 18.\\nForum non conveniens and comity\\nThe second question relates to the role of forum non conveniens and principles of comity in the exercise under section 16.\\nThe doctrine of forum non conveniens, it hardly needs to be said, is that a stay of English proceedings will be granted if another forum is more appropriate in the sense of more suitable for the ends of justice.\\nIt was definitively adopted from Scots law by the decisions of the House of Lords in The Abidin Daver [1984] AC 398 and Spiliada Maritime Corpn v Cansulex Ltd [1987] AC 460, and was applied to stays of English matrimonial proceedings in de Dampierre v de Dampierre [1988] AC 92.\\nThe doctrine was in its infancy in England when the Law Commission reported and when the 1984 Act was enacted substantially in line with the Law Commissions draft Bill.\\nIn several decisions the Court of Appeal has drawn an analogy between the exercise in Part III, of determining whether it is appropriate for an order to be made by a court in England and Wales, and the grant of stays on the ground of forum non conveniens.\\nFor example, in Jordan v Jordan [2000] 1 W.L.R. 210, 220, a Part III case, Thorpe LJ said that de Dampierre v de Dampierre [1988] AC 92 establishes the importance of fixing the primary jurisdiction before competitive litigation in more than one jurisdiction has unnecessarily depleted available assets.\\nIt is equally important to outlaw unnecessary competitive litigation after the primary jurisdiction identified by common consent has performed its essential function to divide assets and income.\\nSee also Holmes v Holmes [1989] Fam 47, 54 55, 59; Moore v Moore [2007] 2 FLR 339, at [109].\\nIn the present case Ward LJ relied (at [44] [45]) on the classic stay cases, Spiliada Maritime Corpn v Cansulex Ltd and de Dampierre v de Dampierre, to conclude that substantial justice had been done in Nigeria, and that an order should not have been made in England under Part III.\\nHaving referred to the fact that Ryder J had refused to grant the wife an anti suit injunction (and no doubt would have granted the husband a stay of the English proceedings), Ward LJ concluded that it would need some compelling reason to conclude one day that the husband would be entitled to a stay of the English proceedings on the basis that substantial justice could be done in the appropriate forum (or that the wife would not be entitled to an anti suit injunction), only to decide very soon afterwards that a serious injustice had been inflicted on the wife in the proceedings concluded by the court overseas.\\nWard LJ considered (at [53]) that there should be: symmetry between the rules relating to stays and anti suit injunctions on the one hand and the exercise of jurisdiction under section 16 on the other.\\nIt is through that prism that section 16 must be viewed in a case like the one before us.\\nBut the forum non conveniens principles were developed to deal with cases in which it was necessary to decide which of two jurisdictions was the appropriate one in which proceedings were to be brought.\\nSection 16 does not impose a statutory forum non conveniens test.\\nIt does not require the court to determine the only appropriate forum where the case may be tried more suitably for the interests of the parties and the ends of justice.\\nNo choice between jurisdictions is involved.\\nThe whole basis of Part III is that it may be appropriate for two jurisdictions to be involved, one for the divorce and one for ancillary relief.\\nMany of the factors in section 16(2) have much in common with those which would be relevant in a forum non conveniens enquiry, but they are not directed to the question of which of two jurisdictions is appropriate.\\nThey are directed to the question whether it would be appropriate (which is the meaning of the word conveniens in forum conveniens) for an order to be made by a court in England and Wales when ex hypothesi there have already been proceedings in a foreign country (including proceedings in which financial provision has been made).\\nLittle assistance can therefore be obtained from the stay cases (and still less from the anti suit injunction cases) in the Part III exercise.\\nThe task for the judge under Part III is to determine whether it would be appropriate for an order to be made in England, taking account in particular of the factors in section 16(2), notwithstanding that the divorce proceedings were in a foreign country which may well have been the more appropriate forum for the divorce.\\nThe next question is whether principles of comity will add anything useful to the analysis.\\nComity is a term of very elastic content: Dicey, Morris & Collins, Conflict of Laws, 14th ed (2006), paras 1 008 et seq; Collins, in Reform and Development of Private International Law (ed Fawcett, 2002), 89.\\nBut in the present context it may be relevant in three respects.\\nFirst, comity is sometimes used not simply in the sense of courtesy to foreign states and their courts, but also in the sense of rules of public international law which establish the proper limits of national legislative jurisdiction in cases involving a foreign element.\\nIn that sense it will be contrary to comity for United Kingdom legislation to apply in a situation involving a foreign country when the United Kingdom has no reasonable relationship with the situation.\\nThat is not the case here.\\nThere is nothing internationally objectionable in legislation which gives a court power to order financial provision notwithstanding a foreign decree of divorce, whether or not the foreign court has ordered financial provision, provided that the forum has an appropriate connection with the parties or their property.\\nThe whole point of the factors in section 16(2) is to enable the court to weigh the connections of England against the connections with the foreign jurisdiction so as to ensure that there is no improper conflict with the foreign jurisdiction.\\nThat is why in Holmes v Holmes [1989] Fam 47, at 53, Purchas LJ was right to note that section 16 reflected the principles of comity as between competent courts.\\nThe second relevant sense in which comity is used is that a court in one country should not lightly characterise the law or judicial decisions of another country as unjust.\\nBut in the present context it is hardly necessary to resort to comity to establish that elementary principle.\\nThe third sense in which comity may be relevant is that it is said to be the basis for the enforcement and recognition of foreign judgments.\\nPart III allows the court to supplement the order of a foreign court.\\nNigerian maintenance orders are enforceable in England under the Maintenance Orders (Facilities for Enforcement) Act 1920: SI 1959/377.\\nBut there is no obligation to recognise such orders in the sense that they must be regarded as determining the rights of the spouses to financial relief.\\nIt is not likely that the Nigerian order is to be regarded in England as a final judgment, since it is subject to variation by the court which made it: Nigerian Matrimonial Causes Act 1990, section 73(1)(j).\\nIt is not necessary to consider whether it was capable of creating any issue estoppels because Munby J ordered that the crucial findings of fact in the Nigerian proceedings were to stand in the Part III proceedings, including the fact that the wife had failed to prove that she had contributed to the acquisition of the London properties.\\nBut, although the point does not arise on this appeal, a warning note must be struck about the position with regard to States to which Council Regulation (EC) 44/2001 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (the Brussels I Regulation) applies.\\nThe effect of sections 15(2) and 28(4) of the 1984 Act is that the jurisdictional provisions of Part III and Part IV respectively are subject to the Brussels I Regulation (and the Lugano Convention).\\nThose sections do not address the question whether a judgment in a Brussels I Regulation State making financial provision on divorce (or refusing to make such provision) would be entitled to recognition so as to prevent an award under Part III or Part IV.\\nFor the purposes of the Brussels I Regulation and the Lugano Convention there is a distinction between maintenance which is within the scope of the Regulation (Article 5(2), which confers jurisdiction on the courts of the maintenance creditors domicile, in addition to that of the debtors domicile under Article 2); and rights in property arising out of a matrimonial relationship (rgimes matrimoniaux) which are expressly excluded from the scope of the Regulation.\\nThese are autonomous concepts: Case 143/78 de Cavel v de Cavel (No 1) [1979] ECR 1055; Case 120/79 de Cavel v de Cavel (No 2) [1980] ECR 731.\\nThe Brussels II Revised Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) 2201/2003 on jurisdiction and the recognition of judgments in matrimonial matters and matters of parental responsibility) does not apply to the property consequences of the marriage or any other ancillary measures (Recital (8)), or to maintenance obligations (Recital (11)).\\nIt is only necessary to mention that if an award of maintenance had been made in another Member State, the question might arise as to whether the application in England under Part III would be precluded on the basis that the issue of maintenance had been determined in the other jurisdiction and that that determination was entitled to recognition.\\nThat would depend, at least in part, on whether the application was to be characterised as relating to maintenance or to rights in property arising out of a matrimonial relationship.\\nCase C 220/95 Van den Boogaard v Laumen [1997] ECR I 1147, [1997] QB 759 shows that a transfer of property may be in the nature of maintenance if it is intended to ensure the support of a spouse; but a transfer of property which serves only the purpose of a division of property is not in the nature of maintenance, and concerns rights in property arising out of a matrimonial relationship.\\nSee also Schlosser Report on the Accession Convention to the Brussels Convention ([1979] OJ C59), para 50; Moore v Moore [2007] 2 FLR 339 (CA).\\nThis is an area which involves difficult questions which do not arise for decision on this appeal.\\nHardship, injustice, exceptionality and an award of the minimum extent\\nnecessary to remedy the injustice\\nIn its Working Paper (para 48) the Law Commission said that the proposals should be concerned primarily to give a remedy in those exceptional cases where a spouse, usually the wife, had been deprived of financial relief in circumstances where an English court might be driven to hold that it would be unjust to recognise the foreign decree.\\nIt went on to say (at para 51): 51 [W]e think that it should be made clear by express statutory provision that the object of the discretion is to provide for the occasional hard case.\\nWe consider, therefore, that the court should be given power to entertain an application for a financial provision or property adjustment order notwithstanding the existence of a valid foreign divorce, if in the light of all the circumstances of the case (and in particular certain specified circumstances) the case would otherwise be one where serious injustice might arise.\\nOur present inclination is not to favour any requirement that the applicant must establish the facts of the case to be exceptional since he may well belong to a religious or ethnic group in which it is not uncommon, for example, for a wife to be divorced abroad without having a right to claim financial relief.\\nThe Report did not revert to the question of an express provision for hardship, and Part III contains no express reference to hardship, injustice or exceptionality.\\nThere has been a tendency in the Family Division and in the Court of Appeal to regard hardship as a condition for the exercise of the jurisdiction rather than as an important factor to be taken into account where it is present.\\nThere has been a similar tendency in the Court of Appeal to treat the element of exceptionality in the same way, by saying that the jurisdiction should be exercised only in exceptional circumstances: Holmes v Holmes [1989] Fam 47, 59; Hewitson v Hewitson [1995] Fam 100, 105.\\nIt is true that at least one of the purposes of Part III is to remit hardships which have been experienced in the past in the presence of a failure in a foreign jurisdiction to afford appropriate financial relief: Holmes v Holmes at P57, per Purchas LJ.\\nBut hardship is not a pre condition of the exercise of the jurisdiction.\\nThorpe LJ pointed out, correctly, in Jordan v Jordan [2000] 1 WLR 210, 221: as a matter of logic it does not follow that hardship is a necessary prerequisite and I doubt that it was open to Cazalet J. [in N v N (Foreign Divorce: Financial Relief) [1997] 1 FLR 900] to hold that an applicant must prove some hardship or injustice in order to obtain the court's leave.\\nParliament might have so legislated, but it did not.\\nThe statutory criteria are fully expressed.\\nA case in which the applicant crosses the barriers contained in sections 13 and 16 without proving some specific hardship or injustice is perfectly conceivable.\\nThe proposal in the Law Commission Working Paper that the court should have the power to order financial relief following a foreign divorce if the case would otherwise be one where serious injustice might arise was not followed through in the Law Commission Reports draft Bill and finds no place in Part III.\\nThorpe LJ was right to say in Jordan v Jordan (in the same passage at 221) that injustice is not a necessary pre condition.\\nAlthough they are not pre conditions, both hardship and injustice will of course be relevant factors for the court to take into consideration under both section 16 and section 18.\\nThe next question is on what basis the order for financial provision should be made.\\nAmong the provisional recommendations of the Law Commission Working Paper were that English law should govern the principles on which a court granted financial relief, the court should be able to make any financial order it might have made in English divorce proceedings, and should exercise its powers in accordance with the guidelines laid down in section 25 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973: paras 56 57, and recommendations (8) and (9).\\nThis recommendation was also made in the Report, and in the provisions of the draft Bill which became sections 17 and 18.\\nIn decisions at first instance, however, it has been held that it is only appropriate for the English court to intervene with financial relief to the minimum extent necessary so as to remedy the injustice perceived to exist without intervention: A v S (Financial Relief after Overseas US Divorce and Financial Proceedings) [2003] 1 FLR 431, at [98], a decision of Bodey J, applied by Coleridge J in the present case.\\nThere is no statutory basis for this limitation, and it is contrary to principle.\\nFor a example a talaq entitled to recognition may be granted abroad in a big money case when almost all relevant connecting factors are with England.\\nIn those circumstances there would be no reason not to apply English law so as to give the same provision for the wife as she would have obtained had there been divorce proceedings in England.\\nThere would be no need for any enquiry as to the minimum required to remedy the injustice.\\nNor, if the wife had independent means, would an enquiry into hardship be necessary or relevant.\\nBut equally it is not the intention of the legislation in England and Wales to allow a simple top up of the foreign award so as to equate with an English award.\\nThis is apparent from a comparison of Part III with the Scottish provisions of Part IV.\\nThe Scottish provisions have the effect that if certain jurisdictional criteria, and certain conditions, are fulfilled, then the application for financial relief is treated as a purely domestic application in Scottish matrimonial proceedings.\\nThe explanation is to be found in the Scottish Law Commission Report (Scot.\\nLaw Com.\\nNo 72, 1982): 2.12 The problem is to find a solution which will enable financial provision after a foreign divorce to be claimed and awarded in appropriate cases, but will not enable it to be claimed or awarded in inappropriate cases 2.13 It is here that we find ourselves differing from the Law Commission.\\nThey prefer a solution in which there are wide grounds of jurisdiction and in which it is left to the courts, guided by a list of factors to be taken into account, to sift out cases where an award would be inappropriate.\\nWe prefer a solution in which there are stricter grounds of jurisdiction and the legislation identifies certain cases as inappropriate in advance.\\nIn our view, a system based on rules is likely to be fairer to defenders and less objectionable to other countries than a system which depends almost entirely on judicial self restraint.\\nWe accept that strict rules on jurisdiction may exclude some cases which a judge in his discretion might allow to proceed.\\nA power to award financial provision after a foreign divorce is, however, a new and exceptional one in our law, and we would rather proceed with caution .\\nThe consequence was that the Scottish provisions in Part IV of the 1984 Act provided that the court could entertain an application for an order for financial provision in Scotland after a divorce in a foreign country, if certain jurisdictional requirements and conditions were satisfied: section 28(1).\\nBut once these were satisfied, the case was to be treated as if it were a Scottish divorce.\\nThe jurisdictional requirements were that (a) the applicant was domiciled or habitually resident in Scotland on the day when the application was made; and (b) the other party to the marriage was domiciled or habitually resident in Scotland when the application was made; or was domiciled or habitually resident in Scotland when the parties last lived together as husband or wife; or was, when the application was made, an owner or tenant of, or had a beneficial interest in, property in Scotland which had at some time been a matrimonial home of the parties: section 28(2).\\nThe conditions were that: (a) the divorce fell to be recognised in Scotland; (b) the other party to the marriage initiated the proceedings for divorce; (c) the application was made within 5 years after the date when the divorce took effect; (d) a court in Scotland would have had jurisdiction to entertain an action for divorce between the parties if such an action had been brought in Scotland immediately before the foreign divorce took effect; (e) the marriage had a substantial connection with Scotland; and (f) both parties were living at the time of the application: section 28(3).\\nOnce these conditions were fulfilled, in disposing of the application under section 28, the court shall exercise its powers so as to place the parties, in so far as it is reasonable and practicable to do so, in the financial position in which they would have been if the application had been disposed of, in an action for divorce in Scotland, on the date on which the foreign divorce took effect: section 29(2).\\nIn determining what is reasonable and practicable the court shall have regard to the parties resources and any order of the foreign court: section 29(3).\\nThis is not the solution adopted in Part III.\\nSection 18 could have provided that, once England and Wales was to be regarded as the appropriate forum under section 16, then the case was to be treated as a purely English proceeding for financial relief.\\nBut it did not do so.\\nInstead a more flexible approach was deliberately adopted.\\nThere will be some cases, with a strong English connection, where it will be appropriate to ask what provision would have been made had the divorce been granted in England.\\nThere will be other cases where the connection is not strong and a spouse has received adequate provision from the foreign court.\\nThen it will not be appropriate for Part III to be used simply as a tool to top up that provision to that which she would have received in an English divorce.\\nThe proper approach\\nTo take up some of the points made in the preceding paragraphs, the proper approach to Part III simply depends on a careful application of sections 16, 17 and 18 in the light of the legislative purpose, which was the alleviation of the adverse consequences of no, or no adequate, financial provision being made by a foreign court in a situation where there were substantial connections with England.\\nThere are two, inter related, duties of the court before making an order under Part III.\\nThe first is to consider whether England and Wales is the appropriate venue for the application: section 16(1).\\nThe second is to consider whether an order should be made under section 17 having regard to the matters in section 18.\\nThere are two reasons why the duties are inter related.\\nFirst, neither section 16(2) nor section 18(2) and (3) refers to an exhaustive list of matters to be taken into account.\\nSection 16(1) directs the court to have regard to all the circumstances of the case and section 16(2) refers the court to certain matters in particular.\\nSecond, some of the matters to be considered under section 16 may be relevant under section 18, and vice versa.\\nAn obvious example would be that section 16(2)(e) refers the court to the financial provision which has been made by the foreign court.\\nPlainly that would be relevant under section 18.\\nSo also the direction in section 18(6) to the court, in considering the financial resources of a party, to have regard to whether an order of a foreign court has been complied with would plainly be relevant in considering whether England is the appropriate venue.\\nIt is not the purpose of Part III to allow a spouse (usually, in current conditions, the wife) with some English connections to make an application in England to take advantage of what may well be the more generous approach in England to financial provision, particularly in so called big money cases.\\nThere is no condition of exceptionality for the purposes of section 16, but it will not usually be a case for an order under Part III where the wife had a right to apply for financial relief under the foreign law, and an award was made in the foreign country.\\nIn such cases mere disparity between that award and what would be awarded on an English divorce will certainly be insufficient to trigger the application of Part III.\\nNor is hardship or injustice (much less serious injustice) a condition of the exercise of the jurisdiction, but if either factor is present, it may make it appropriate, in the light of all the circumstances, for an order to be made, and may affect the nature of the provision ordered.\\nOf course, the court will not lightly characterise foreign law, or the order of a foreign court, as unjust.\\nThe amount of financial provision will depend on all the circumstances of the case and there is no rule that it should be the minimum amount required to overcome injustice.\\nThe following general principles should be applied.\\nFirst, primary consideration must be given to the welfare of any children of the marriage.\\nThis can cut both ways as the children may be being supported by the foreign spouse.\\nSecond, it will never be appropriate to make an order which gives the claimant more than she or he would have been awarded had all proceedings taken place within this jurisdiction.\\nThird, where possible the order should have the result that provision is made for the reasonable needs of each spouse.\\nSubject to these principles, the court has a broad discretion.\\nThe reasons why it was appropriate for an order to be made in England are among the circumstances to be taken into account in deciding what order should be made.\\nWhere the English connections of the case are very strong there may be no reason why the application should not be treated as if it were made in purely English proceedings.\\nThe full procedure for granting ancillary relief after an English divorce does not apply in Part III cases.\\nThe conditions which can be attached to leave, together with the courts case management powers, can be used to define the issues and to limit the evidence to be filed, as was done by Munby J in this case.\\nThis enables the jurisdiction to be tailored to the needs of the individual case, so that the grant of leave does not inevitably trigger a full blown claim for all forms of ancillary relief.\\nThis case\\nTo the extent, therefore, that Coleridge J considered that there was a rule that the provision made under Part III should be the minimum required to overcome an injustice, he was in error, but there is no cross appeal on quantum.\\nIt is not therefore necessary to consider whether a different result would have been justified, particularly since the total provision ordered in both jurisdictions did not fall markedly short of what the wife would have received in a purely English proceeding.\\nThe Court of Appeal erred in principle in applying traditional forum non conveniens principles, and its criticisms of Coleridge Js conclusions did not meet the necessary threshold for interference with the exercise of discretion.\\nTo the extent that the Court of Appeal took the view that Coleridge J relied too much on Munby Js judgment, the criticism is in reality one of lack of adequate reasoning.\\nColeridge Js judgment was an unreserved judgment given after a 2 day hearing against the background of a full exposition of the facts and the law (over, to repeat, some 28 single spaced pages) in the same case by Munby J. Coleridge J was fully entitled to incorporate by reference Munby Js account of the background facts.\\nTo the very limited extent that further facts were to be found (principally as regards the wifes earnings) Coleridge J made appropriate findings.\\nHe cannot be criticised for failing to refer to every relevant factor in section 16(2).\\nWhat the wife received and to what she was entitled in Nigeria were obvious.\\nThe judges reasons (particularly in the light of his incorporation of Munby Js judgment) have to be read on the assumption that the judge knew how he should perform his functions and which matters he should take into account, particularly when those matters had not only been fully set out by Munby J but are familiar to every experienced judge in the Family Division: cf.\\nPiglowski v Piglowska [1999] 1 WLR 1360, 1372 (in relation to the exercise of discretion by reference to the factors in section 25 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973).\\nBecause the Court of Appeal wrongly applied traditional forum non conveniens principles, it erred in criticising Coleridge J for failing to identify which court had the closest and most appropriate connection with the parties or for failing to identify Nigeria as the natural and appropriate forum to deal with the divorce.\\nThe English connections were substantial, if not overwhelming, and Coleridge J plainly took the relevant matters in section 16(2) into account.\\nIt was not so much that there was a very large disparity between what the wife received in Nigeria and what she would have received in England, but that there was also a very large disparity between what the husband received and what the wife received such as to create real hardship and a serious injustice.\\nThere was no basis for interference with the exercise of discretion.\\nThe appeal will be allowed and the order of Coleridge J restored.\\n\")]\n","\n","\n","UK train summary: 693\n","[('uksc-2009-0018.txt', 'In response to various incidents of international terrorism, including the attacks on 9/11, the UN Security Council (the UNSC) passed resolutions (UNSCRs) requiring member states to take steps to freeze the assets of: (i) Usama Bin Laden, the Taliban and their associates;

(ii) the fact that the TO allowed asset freezing on grounds of reasonable suspicion; and (iii) the fact that the AQO entirely deprived those named in the Consolidated List of any right of access to a court.\\nFollowing the hearing in the case, the Treasury issued new designations in respect of A, K, M and G under the authority of the Terrorism Order (United Nations Measures) 2009 (the TO 2009).\\nThe terms of the TO 2009 are substantially similar to those of the TO.\\nThe Supreme Court has unanimously held that the TO should be quashed as ultra vires s.1(1) of the 1946 Act.\\nIt also held by a majority of six to one (Lord Brown dissenting) that Article 3(1)(b) of the AQO must also be quashed as ultra vires.\\nIt was noted that if the designations in respect of A, K, M and G imposed subsequent to the hearing pursuant to the TO 2009 had been before the Supreme Court these too would have been quashed.\\nGeneral Remarks Lord Hope (with the agreement of Lord Walker and Lady Hale) giving the leading judgment, noted the far reaching and serious effect of the asset freezing measures on the individuals concerned and their families [paras [4], [38], [39] and [60]]. s.1(1) of the 1946 Act allows Orders in Council to be made without even the most basic Parliamentary scrutiny [paras [48] [50]].\\nIn the absence of Parliamentary control the Court must carefully examine such drastic measures [paras [5], [6] and [53]].\\nAustralia and New Zealand gave effect to their UNSCR obligations by primary legislation that was subjected to the scrutiny and approval of their respective legislatures.\\nAlso, the Anti terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 enacted an asset freezing regime that is significantly less onerous and attended by greater safeguards than the system established by the TO and AQO [paras [51] [54]].\\nThe legislative history of the 1946 Act demonstrates that Parliament did not intend that the 1946 Act should be used to introduce coercive measures which interfere with UK citizens fundamental rights [paras [16] and [44]].\\nThe principle of legality requires that general or ambiguous statutory words should not be interpreted in a manner that infringes fundamental rights [paras [45] and [46]], and s.1(1) of the 1946 Act must be interpreted in this light.\\nOrders made under s.1(1) would therefore only be legitimate when the interference with fundamental rights to which they give rise is no greater than that which the underlying UNSCR requires [para [47]].\\nThe TO The relevant UNSCRs did not address the standard of proof for imposing asset freezes.\\nThe reasonable suspicion standard in the TO must be assessed in light of the entire system that the TO establishes, particularly the seriousness of the interferences with fundamental rights that it effects [paras [58] [60]].\\nBy introducing a test of reasonable suspicion the Treasury exceeded the power conferred by s.1(1) of the 1946 Act [para [61]].\\nThe AQO\\nLord Hope noted that the effect of the AQO, in this case, did not rely upon a reasonable suspicion criterion and that in contrast to the TO the AQO does not go beyond the relevant UNSCRs [para [64]].\\nBut there are no means whereby G or HAY can challenge the decision to list them as terrorists, with the consequence that their assets are frozen automatically, before an independent and impartial judge [paras [77] [80]].\\nArticle 3(1)(b) of the AQO must therefore be quashed [paras [81] and [82]].\\nThe Status of the Designations Against A, K, M and G pursuant to the TO 2009 The principal criticisms directed against the TO apply equally to the TO 2009 [paras [28]].\\nHad the TO 2009 been before the Court it would have been quashed [para [83]].\\nOther Comments Nobody should form the impression that in quashing the TO and the operative provision of the AQO the Court displaces the will of Parliament.\\nOn the contrary, the Courts judgment vindicates the primacy of Parliament, as opposed to the Executive, in determining in what circumstances fundamental rights may legitimately be restricted [para [157] per Lord Phillips].\\nThe features of the AQO that are characterised as objectionable are the ineluctable consequence of giving effect to the relevant UNSCRs the same apparent deficiency would apply to primary legislation.\\nAccordingly, the AQO should be upheld [paras [203] [204] per Lord Brown (dissenting)].\\n')]\n","\n","\n","IN train judgement: 7030\n","[('118.txt', '399 of 1952.\\nPetition under article 32 of the Constitution of India for a writ in the nature of habeas corpus, Godavari Parutekar, the petitioner, in person.\\nM.

Mehta, with him) for the respondent.\\nDecember 5.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by BosE J.\\nThis is a habeas corpus petition under article 32 of the Constitution.\\nThe petitioner was detained the, 16th of October, 1951, under the of 1950 as amended in 1951.\\nHer detention was actually longer than this but the earlier detentions were under a different set of orders which are not relevant to the present matter.\\nThe present detention is based an order of the District Magistrate, Thana, and merely says that the petitioner be detained, without specifying any period.\\nThe order of confirmation was passed the 4th of January, 1952, and there again no period was specified.\\nThe petitioner \\'s case is that as no period was specified in the order her period of detention expired the 31st of March, 1952, because of the amending Act of 1951 ; or at the outside the 30th of September, 1952, because of Act XXXIV of 1952 which effected a further amendment.\\nThe reply behalf of the State of Bombay is that the of 1950 was again amended by Act LXI of 1952 and that the effect of this amendment was to carry the petitioner \\'s detention to the 31st of March, 1953, because of section 11 A which was added to the original Act of 1950.\\nThe petitioner counters by saying that the new Act does not apply to cases in which the order of detention is not silent about its duration and so section 11 A does not serve to extend the period of her detention.\\nShe relies the following portion of section II A (2) \". every detention order which has been confirmed under section 11 before the commencement of the Preventive Detention (Second Amendment) Act 1952, shall, unless a shorter priod is specified in the order, continue to remain in force until the Ist day of April, 1953. \" The petitioner concedes that no shorter period is specified in her order of detention but contends that as her detention would have expired either the 31st of March, 1952, or the 30th of September, 1952, one of those two dates must now be read into the order and when that is done we have an order which specifies as shorter period, therefore section 11 A (2) does not serve to extend her detention.\\nWe are unable to accept this contention.\\nThe section is clear and unless a shorter period is specified in the order, section I 1 A(2) applies.\\nWe cannot add the words \"or must be deemed to have been specified by reason of the expiry of the earlier Act\" into the section.\\nWe hold therefore that section 11 A(2) validly extended the period of detention till the Ist of April, 1953.\\n1 The petitioner \\'s next point is based articles 14 and 22(i)(b) of the Constitution. \\' It arises in this way.\\nSection 3 (1) (a) of the of 1950 classifies grounds of permissible detention into three categories.\\nArticle 22 (7) (b) empowers Parliament to prescribe the maximum period for which any person may \"in any class or classes of cases\" be detained.\\nThe petitioner argues that this permits only one maximum for each class and that if different maxima are provided for \"equals\" within a class it offends not only article 22 (7) (b) but also article 14 as interpreted by the decisions of this Court, She next argues that section 11 A, now introduced by the second amending Act of 1952 (Act LXI of 1952), does just that and so is ultra vires.\\nHer point is put as follows.\\nSub section (1) of section 11 A states that the maximum period for which any person may be detained in pursuance of any detention order which has been confirmed under section 1 1 shall be twelve months from the date of detention.\\nBut sub section (2) qualifies this by dividing detentions into two classes; 213 (a) those in which the detention order was confirmed before 30th of September, 1952, and (b) those in which the confirmation was after that date, and it provides that.\\nin the former case, unless a shorter period is specified in the order, the detention shall continue either till the 1st of April, 1953, or for twelve months from the date of detention, whichever expires later.\\nThis, she says, introduces a fresh classification which divides detentions into those before the Act and those after.\\nThat, she says, is ultra vires, first, because it introduces a discriminatory classification in the class to which she belongs under section 3 of the Act and, second, because it entails discrimination even in the fresh class into which she has been thrown by the new sub division, made by the second amending Act of 1952.\\nAs regards the first point, the ratio decidendi in Shamrao V. Parulekar vs The District Magistrate, Thana, and Others(1) applies here.\\nIn that case, detentions were divided into those which had already been considered by an Advisory Board and those which had not.\\nThis was upheld.\\nThe dividing line here is different, namely a certain date, but the principle is the same and its reasonableness is apparent from a consideration of the various amendments which have been made from time to time.\\nThe life of the Act of 1950, which was the principal Act, was extended till the 1st of October, 1952, by section 2 of the amending Act (Act XXXIV of 1952), and the effect of section 3 was to prolong the \\' life of all detentions in force on 14th of March 1952, (provided they had been confirmed before that date) for so long as the principal Act was in force.\\nAt that date this meant till the 1st of October, 1952.\\nBut the second amending Act of 1952 extended the life of the principal Act till the 31st of December,1954.\\nTherefore, in the absence of section 11 A all those detentions would have been extended till that date.\\nBut section 11 A modified that and put 1st of April,1953, as the latest date for these old detentions, (1) ; at 691 and 693.\\n214 It therefore conferred a benefit and cannot be deemed unreasonable.\\nSub section (3) of \\'section 11 A shows that that was the object.\\nBut the petitioner attacked the provisions on the ground of discrimination.\\nShe said that even assuming the new classification of detentions into those before and after the 30th of September, 1952, to be good, section 11 A is nevertheless discriminatory because it discriminates amongst those in her class,, namely those whose detentions were made and confirmed before the 30th of September.\\nShe put it in this way.\\nTaking the case of her own detention, she pointed, out that if section II A is good, it will continue till the 1st of April, 1953, that is to say, her detention will have been for a period of 17 1/2 months from the 16th of October, 1951, till the 1st of April, 1953. \\'On the other hand, a person detained after her on, say, the last of September, 1952, would also be due for release on the 1st of April, 1953, and so would have had only six months \\' detention.\\nThis, in our opinion, is not discrimination within the meaning of article 14.\\nA maximum can be fixed, either by specifying a particular period, such as twelve months, or by setting an outside limit, land it is inevitable in such a case that the length of detention will vary in each individual case.\\nThose taken into detention at a later date are bound to be detained for a shorter time.\\nGovernment is not bound to detain everybody for the same length of time.\\n, It has a discretion.\\nMoreover, the appropriate Government has boon left power to revoke or modify the detention order at any earlier time.\\nThis point was considered in Shamrao V. Parulekar vs The District Magistrate, Thana, & Others (1) and was decided against the detenu.\\nThe petitioner endeavoured to have her application reopened on the merits contending again that the grounds of detention are vague.\\nShe relies on Shamrao V. Parulekar vs The State, of Bombay (2) where (1) ; at 691 at 693.\\n(2) Petition No. 86 of 1952.\\n215 another detenu was released by another Bench of this Court in circumstances which., according to her, are very similar.\\nWe are unable to allow this as her petition has already been rejected on the merits.\\nShe was only allowed to appear on constitutional points.\\nWe understand that in the other petition this fact was not brought to the notice of the Court.\\nThe application is dismissed.\\nApplication dismissed.\\n')]\n","\n","\n","IN train summary: 7030\n","[('1129.txt', 'Order 32, r.

2010.\\nOn 14 April 2010, while we were still considering our decision upon it, we were asked to consider applications for permission to appeal in two other cases in which foreign national prisoners had been detained pending their deportation after completing their sentences of imprisonment.\\nWalumba Lumba, a citizen of the Democratic Republic of Congo, sought permission to appeal from a decision of the Court of Appeal [2010] EWCA Civ 111, [2010] 1 WLR 2168, dismissing his appeal from a decision of Collins J [2008] EWHC 2090 (Admin) on his claim for judicial review to refuse him a declaration that his detention by the Secretary of State for the Home Department was unlawful, for a mandatory order for his release and for damages.\\nMr Lumba together with Kadian Mighty, a citizen of Jamaica, also sought permission to appeal against the Court of Appeals decision dismissing their appeals from a decision of Davis J [2008] EWHC 3166 (Admin) to dismiss their claims for judicial review of the Secretary of States decision to detain them prior to their deportation and for damages for unlawful detention.\\nWe decided to give permission to appeal in both cases, and a direction was given that the appeals should be heard by a panel of nine Justices.\\nAs there was plainly a close relationship between the issues raised in those cases and this, we decided to withhold delivery of our judgments in this case until after the decision of nine Justices in the cases of Mr Lumba and Mr Mighty had been given.\\nFollowing the delivery of the judgment of their cases in R (Lumba) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 12, [2011] 2 WLR 671 on 11 March 2011 the parties were invited to make written submissions in light of that judgment.\\nHaving received and considered their submissions, we are now in a position to give our judgment in this case.\\nThe appellant is a national of Zimbabwe.\\nHe entered the United Kingdom with leave as a visitor and was then given leave to remain for one year as a student.\\nBut he overstayed his leave and, following his conviction for several criminal offences, he was sentenced to a period of imprisonment.\\nThe Secretary of State decided that he should be deported.\\nOn 8 March 2006 he was detained pending the making of a deportation order.\\nHe remained in detention for 27 months until 13 June 2008 when he was released on bail by the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal.\\nOn 12 November 2007 while still detained he sought judicial review by means of a mandatory order for his immediate release, a declaration that he was unlawfully detained and damages.\\nOn 25 January 2008 Munby J granted a declaration that the appellant had been detained unlawfully for various distinct periods amounting to about 19 months and he gave directions for the assessment of damages: [2008] EWHC 98 (Admin).\\nBut he declined to make an order for his release.\\nThe Secretary of State appealed against the declaration.\\nThe appellant appealed against the refusal of an order for his release, but he was later granted bail and that appeal was not proceeded with.\\nOn 6 November 2008 the Court of Appeal (Laws, Keene and Longmore LJJ) allowed the Secretary of States appeal, holding that the appellants detention had been lawful throughout.\\nIt remitted a new point which had been raised about the legality of the appellants detention during periods when Munby J held that he was lawfully detained for determination by the High Court: [2008] EWCA Civ 1204, [2009] 1 WLR 1527.\\nThe appellant now appeals to this court against the decision by the Court of Appeal that he is not entitled to damages for false imprisonment.\\nAnonymity\\nThe appellant has been referred to hitherto in these proceedings as SK (Zimbabwe).\\nMr Tam QC for the respondent invited the court to maintain the order for the appellants anonymity in accordance with the practice for asylum cases recognised by the Court of Appeal.\\nHe suggested that references in the appellants application for asylum might expose him to risk if he were to be returned to Zimbabwe.\\nMr Husain for the appellant on the other hand did not ask for the order to be maintained.\\nHe did not suggest that there were any reasons for concern in his case.\\nHe said that he adopted a position of neutrality on this issue.\\nThere is no doubt that the court has power to make an anonymity order to restrain publication of a person named in its proceedings.\\nIn an extreme case, where he or his family are in peril of their lives or safety, this may help to secure his rights under articles 2 and 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights: In re Guardian News and Media Ltd [2010] UKSC 1, [2010] 2 WLR 325, para 26.\\nThose are the rights that are most likely to be relevant if he is seeking asylum.\\nIt may also be made to secure that other persons, such as the press, show respect for his private and family life under article 8 of the Convention.\\nBut in such cases the persons article 8 rights must be balanced against the article 10 rights of the press and the general public interest in his being identified: In re Guardian News and Media Ltd, para 76.\\nAs the decision in that case shows, however, much will depend on the circumstances of each case.\\nIt is no longer the case that all asylum seekers as a class are entitled to anonymity in this Court.\\nThe making of such an order has to be justified.\\nI am not persuaded that an order for the appellants anonymity is justified in this case.\\nIt must be recognised, of course, that lifting the order for his anonymity is not entirely without risk.\\nIt is rarely possible to predict with complete confidence what risks a failed asylum seeker will face when he is returned to his home country.\\nBut the position that the asylum seeker himself adopts will always be an important factor.\\nHe is likely to be in the best position to assess the risks and to say whether or not he needs anonymity for his protection.\\nHis counsel, Mr Husain, is very experienced in these matters and well able to form a sound judgment as to whether this is necessary or desirable.\\nI would have expected him to inform the court if there were any grounds at all for wishing to preserve the appellants anonymity.\\nHad he done so I would, of course, have given a good deal of weight to his submissions.\\nAs it is, in view of the position that he has adopted on the appellants behalf, I am not persuaded that there is anything to prevent his being identified in this case.\\nI would set aside the anonymity order, and name the appellant as Shepherd Masimba Kambadzi.\\nThe appellants case\\nThe context for the appellants claim of damages for false imprisonment is provided by the provisions for the regulation of entry and stay in the United Kingdom which are set out in Part 1 of the Immigration Act 1971, as amended.\\nHis case, put very simply, is that the discretionary power to detain that is vested in the Secretary of State by paragraphs 2(2) and (3) of Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act was not exercised throughout his period of detention in the way it should have been according to the published policy, that for periods when his detention was not reviewed in accordance with the policy it was not authorised and that he is entitled to damages for false imprisonment because his continued detention was unlawful during those periods.\\nA description of the statutory background and the system which, according to his own policy, the Secretary of State had undertaken to operate provides the starting point for an examination of this argument.\\nThe facts of this case are best understood in the light of that background.\\nThe statutory background\\nSection 4 of the 1971 Act provides that the power to give or refuse leave to enter the United Kingdom shall be exercised by immigration officers and that the power to give leave to remain in the United Kingdom, or to vary any leave, shall be exercised by the Secretary of State.\\nSection 3(5) renders a person who is not a British citizen liable to deportation if the Secretary of State deems his deportation to be conducive to the public good.\\nSection 4 gives effect to Schedule 2, paragraph 1(3) of which provides: In the exercise of their functions under this Act immigration officers shall act in accordance with such instructions (not inconsistent with the immigration rules) as may be given them by the Secretary of State.\\nSection 5(3) of the 1971 Act gives effect to Schedule 3 with respect to the removal from the United Kingdom of persons against whom deportation orders are in force and the detention and control of persons in connection with deportation.\\nParagraph 2 of Schedule 3 appears under the heading Detention or control pending deportation.\\nIt provides in subparagraphs (2) and (3): (2) Where notice has been given to a person in accordance with regulations under section 105 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (notice of decision) of a decision to make a deportation order against him, and he is not a detained person in pursuance of the sentence or order of a court, he may be detained under the authority of the Secretary of State pending the making of the deportation order. (3) Where a deportation order is in force against any person, he may be detained under the authority of the Secretary of State pending his removal or departure from the United Kingdom and if already detained by virtue of sub paragraph (1) or (2) above when the order is made, shall continue to be detained unless he is released on bail or the Secretary of State directs otherwise. [emphasis added]\\nAt first sight, the effect of paragraph 2(3) of the Schedule is that, once notice has been given of a decision to make a deportation order against him, the person may lawfully be detained until he is removed or departs.\\nBut, as Munby J observed in para 9 of his judgment, the powers conferred by those paragraphs are not unfettered.\\nIn R v Governor of Durham Prison, Ex p Hardial Singh [1984] 1 WLR 704, 706 Woolf J said: Although the power which is given to the Secretary of State in paragraph 2 to detain individuals is not subject to any express limitation of time, I am quite satisfied that it is subject to limitations.\\nFirst of all, it can only authorise detention if the individual is being detained pending his removal.\\nIt cannot be used for any other purpose.\\nSecondly, as the power is given in order to enable the machinery of deportation to be carried out, I regard the power of detention as being impliedly limited to a period which is reasonably necessary for that purpose.\\nThe period which is reasonable will depend upon the circumstances of the particular case.\\nWhat is more, if there is a situation where it is apparent to the Secretary of State that he is not going to be able to operate the machinery provided in the Act for removing persons who are intended to be deported within a reasonable period, it seems to me that it would be wrong for the Secretary of State to exercise his power of detention.\\nIn addition, I would regard it as implicit that the Secretary of State should exercise all reasonable expedition to ensure that the steps are taken which will be necessary to ensure the removal of the individual within a reasonable time.\\nThis statement was referred to with approval in Tan Te Lam v Superintendent of Tai A Chau Detention Centre [1997] AC 97.\\nLord Browne Wilkinson said of the power to detain pending removal in the Hong Kong Ordinance at p 111A D: Their Lordships have no doubt that in conferring such a power to interfere with individual liberty, the legislature intended that such power could only be exercised reasonably and that accordingly it was implicitly so limited.\\nThe principles enunciated by Woolf J in the Hardial Singh case [1984] 1 WLR 704 are statements of the limitations on a statutory power of detention pending removal.\\nIn the absence of contrary indications in the statute which confers the power to detain pending removal their Lordships agree with the principles stated by Woolf J.\\nIn A v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] UKHL 56, [2005] 2 AC 68, para 8 Lord Bingham of Cornhill said that Woolf Js guidance in Hardial Singh had never been questioned.\\nIn R (I) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2002] EWCA Civ 888, [2003] INLR 196, para 46, Dyson LJ said that counsel had correctly submitted that the following four principles (the Hardial Singh principles) emerge from it: (i) The Secretary of State must intend to deport the person and can only use the power to detain for that purpose; (ii) The deportee may only be detained for a period that is reasonable in all the circumstances; (iii) If, before the expiry of the reasonable period, it becomes apparent that the Secretary of State will not be able to effect deportation within that reasonable period, he should not seek to exercise the power of detention; (iv) The Secretary of State should act with reasonable diligence and expedition to effect removal.\\nIt was common ground in R (Lumba) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] 2 WLR 671 that in this passage the effect of Woolf Js judgment was correctly summarised and it was approved as an accurate statement of the relevant principles: see, eg, paras 171 174.\\nAs Lady Hale said at para 199, the detention must be for the statutory purposes of making or implementing a deportation order and for no other purpose.\\nThe cases were reviewed by Lord Brown of Eaton under Heywood in R (Khadir) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005] UKHL 39, [2006] 1 AC 207, where the power to detain was exercised under Schedule 2 in the context of removing those refused leave to enter.\\nLord Brown said that, while it went without saying that the longer the delay in effecting someones removal the more difficult it becomes to justify the continued detention meanwhile, that was by no means to say that he does not remain liable to detention: para 31.\\nIn para 33 he said: To my mind the Hardial Singh line of cases says everything about the exercise of the power to detain (when it properly can be exercised and when it cannot); nothing about its existence.\\nThis case is about the way in which the power to detain can properly be exercised, but it raises issues about the existence of the power too.\\nDoes the Secretary of States failure to comply with his published policy for regular reviews to monitor changing circumstances deprive him of his executive power to continue to detain the detainee? Or does his power continue until a review shows that continued detention is no longer appropriate? I think that an examination of the Hardial Singh principles may help to resolve these questions, as they give rise to the need for these reviews.\\nBut it is clear that the appellant cannot succeed in his claim by relying solely on those principles.\\nMr Husain for the appellant submits that, while the Secretary of States decision to detain was lawful at its inception, it could become unlawful with the passage of time.\\nThere was no challenge to the judges findings that throughout the period that the appellant was detained the Hardial Singh principles were complied with.\\nIn the Court of Appeal Laws LJ said that the judge was entitled to be so satisfied: [2009] 1 WLR 1527, para 36.\\nBut Mr Husains case is that the matter does not rest there.\\nHe says that the Secretary of States published policy also regulates the existence of the power to continue detention, and that it must be followed in the absence of good reason not to do so.\\nThe published policy\\nBefore I come to the published policy I should mention that the Secretary of State was given power by the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 to make rules for the regulation and management of detention centres.\\nRule 9 of the Detention Centre Rules 2001 (SI 2001/238) provides: (1) Every detained person will be provided, by the Secretary of State, with written reasons for his detention at the time of his initial decision, and thereafter monthly. (2) The Secretary of State shall, within a reasonable time following any request to do so by a detained person, provide that person with an update on the progress of any relevant matter relating to him.\\nRule 9(3) sets out a list of relevant matters for the purposes of that paragraph.\\nIn the Court of Appeal, para 45, Keene LJ said that it was clearly implicit in the rule that the Secretary of State has to reconsider the justification for detention, month by month, in the light of changing circumstances.\\nAt para 46 he said: The need for such regular reviews stems from the necessity for the Secretary of State to monitor changing circumstances in a given case lest his power to detain, on the principles set out in Ex p Hardial Singh [1984] 1 WLR 704, no longer exists.\\nEven if the power still exists, he has a discretion to exercise which he must also keep under review.\\nThe importance of the detainee receiving regular statements of the reason why he is still detained is self evident: he needs to be in a position to know whether he can properly challenge the Secretary of States decision in the courts by way of an application for habeas corpus or judicial review or whether he can apply for bail on a meaningful basis.\\nSo the requirements imposed by rule 9 cannot be treated lightly, especially when one is dealing with administrative detention which deprives a person of his liberty without a court order.\\nI agree with these observations, but I would prefer to apply them to the system of review that is set out in the policy rather than to the system required by rule 9(1).\\nThis is because it seems to me that the 2001 Rules are concerned with the regulation and management of detention centres, not with the way the discretion to detain is exercised.\\nThis is what the explanatory note says, and I think that Keene LJ was right to conclude in para 47 that rule 9(1) is not concerned with limiting the Secretary of States power to detain.\\nIn any event the appellant was detained in prison conditions to which the Rules do not apply for the first 14 months of the period of his detention.\\nIt was not until April 2007 that he was moved to a detention centre and the Rules applied to his case.\\nI come then to the Secretary of States policy.\\nIt is to be found in a document issued by the Home Office called the Operations Enforcement Manual.\\nVarious versions of this manual have been existence since at least 2001.\\nMr Tam informed the Court that it was safe to proceed on the basis that the version used in these proceedings, which was downloaded in 2007, was the one that was in circulation while the appellant was being held in detention.\\nChapter 38 of the manual is entitled Detention and Temporary Release.\\nIt is here that the published policies regulating the exercise of the Secretary of States discretion, in accordance with the Hardial Singh principles, are set out.\\nParagraph 38.1, headed Policy refers to the 1998 White Paper Fairer, Faster and Firmer: a Modern Approach to Immigration and Asylum (1998) (Cm 4018) in which it was said there was a presumption in favour of temporary admission or release and that detention would most usually be appropriate to effect removal, initially to establish a persons identity or basis of claim or where there is reason to believe that the person will fail to comply with any conditions attached to the grant of temporary admission or release.\\nIt refers also to the 2002 White Paper Secure Borders, Safe Haven: Integration with Diversity in Modern Britain (2002) (Cm 5687) in which the principles stated in the 1998 White Paper were reiterated.\\nThese criteria are said to represent the Governments stated policy on the use of detention.\\nThere then follows this important acknowledgement of the significance of the policy in public law: To be lawful, detention must not only be based on one of the statutory powers and accord with the limitations implied by domestic and Strasbourg case law but must also accord with this stated policy. [emphasis added] Under the sub heading Use of Detention these words appear: In all cases detention must be used sparingly, and for the shortest period necessary.\\nParagraph 38.3 is headed Factors influencing a decision to detain (excluding pre decision fast track cases).\\nIt contains the following instructions: 1.\\nThere is a presumption in favour of temporary admission or temporary release. 2.\\nThere must be strong grounds for believing that a person will not comply with conditions of temporary admission or temporary release for detention to be justified. 3.\\nAll reasonable alternatives to detention must be considered before detention is authorised. 4.\\nOnce detention has been authorised it must be kept under close review to ensure that it continues to be justified. 5.\\nEach case must be considered on its individual merits.\\nVarious factors which must be taken into account when considering the need for initial or continued detention are then set out.\\nThey include, among other things, the likelihood of the person being removed and, if so, after what timescale; whether there is any history of previous absconding or of failure to comply with conditions of temporary release or bail; and whether there is a previous history of complying with the requirements of immigration control.\\nParagraph 38.5 is headed Levels of authority for detention.\\nIt states: Although the power in law to detain an illegal entrant rests with the [immigration officer], or the relevant non warranted immigration caseworker under the authority of the Secretary of State, in practice, an officer of at least [Chief Immigration Officer] rank, or a senior caseworker, must give authority.\\nDetention must then be reviewed at regular intervals (see 38.8).\\nParagraph 38.5.2 states that the decision as to whether a person subject to deportation action should be detained under Immigration Act powers is taken by a senior caseworker in the Criminal Casework Directorate.\\nParagraph 38.6 is headed Detention Forms.\\nThe opening sentence states: The Government stated in the 1998 White Paper that written reasons for detention should be given in all cases at the time of detention and thereafter at monthly intervals. [emphasis in the original] The authority to detain is known as Form IS91.\\nParagraph 38.6.1, which is headed Form IS91RA Risk Assessment, states: Once it has been identified that the person is one who should be detained, consideration should be given as to what, if any, level of risk that person may present whilst in detention. [Immigration officers] should undertake the checks detailed on form IS91RA part A Risk Factors (in advance, as far as possible, in a planned operation/visit when it is anticipated detention will be required.\\nParagraph 38.6.2, which is headed Form IS9I Authority to Detain, states that once the Detainee Escorting and Population Management Unit has decided on the location for detention they will forward a form to the detaining office detailing the detention location and the assessment of risk, which is attached to form IS91 and served on the detaining agent.\\nIf there is an alteration in risk factors a new form IS91 is issued.\\nParagraph 38.8 is headed Detention Reviews.\\nIt is on its provisions that the appellants argument that from time to time during the period of his detention he was detained unlawfully depends.\\nIt identifies the grade of officer by whom initial detention must be authorised.\\nIt then states: Continued detention in all cases of persons in sole detention under Immigration Act powers must be subject to administrative review at regular intervals.\\nAt each review robust and formally documented consideration should be given to the removability of the detainee.\\nA formal and documented review of detention should be made after 24 hours by an Inspector and thereafter, as directed, at the 7, 14, 21 and 28 day points.\\nAt the 14 day stage, or if circumstances change between weekly reviews an Inspector must conduct the review.\\nIn [the Criminal Casework Directorate] an [higher executive officer] reviews detention up to 2 months. [A senior executive officer/Her Majestys inspector] reviews detention up to 4 months, the Assistant Director/Grade 7 up to 8 months, the Deputy Director up to 11 months and the Director up to 12 months and over. [emphasis in the original]\\nThe facts\\nThe appellant arrived in this country on 30 October 2002 as a visitor with six months leave to enter.\\nOn 9 May 2003 he applied for leave to remain for two years as a student.\\nHe was granted leave for one year until 30 April 2004.\\nAfter that date he remained here without leave.\\nOn 9 December 2005 he was convicted on two counts of common assault and one count of sexual assault on a female.\\nHe was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment and ordered to be registered as a sex offender for five years.\\nThe judge did not recommend deportation.\\nBut on 7 March 2006, the day before he was due to be released from prison after serving six months of his sentence including time spent on remand, the Secretary of State decided to make a deportation order against him.\\nHe was detained under paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act and remained in custody at HMP Woodhill.\\nOn 24 March 2006 the appellant claimed asylum.\\nOn 11 April 2006 he asked the Secretary of State to move him from the prison to a detention centre, but his request was ignored.\\nOn 18 April 2006 the Citizens Advice Bureau wrote two letters to the Secretary of State on his behalf.\\nIn one it requested his urgent transfer to a detention centre.\\nIn the other it appealed against the notice of decision to make a deportation order.\\nOn 20 April 2006 and again on 3 May 2006 the Citizens Advice Bureau wrote to the Secretary of State on the appellants behalf contending that his continued detention was unlawful.\\nMunby J said in para 19(xvi) that these letters were clearly relying upon the Hardial Singh principles, but they went unanswered.\\nOn 17 May 2006 the appellant, who had now been moved to HMP Lincoln, applied for bail.\\nHis application was refused on 19 May 2006.\\nHe applied for bail again on 15 September 2006.\\nOn 19 September 2006 the Secretary of State refused his application for asylum.\\nTwo days later, on 21 September 2006, the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Tribunal heard his appeals against the decision to deport, the refusal of asylum and a refusal to grant him relief on human rights grounds.\\nThe tribunal refused bail, having noted that he had previously committed an offence under the Bail Act 1976.\\nOn 4 October 2006 the Tribunal issued its decision dismissing all three appeals.\\nIt stated that the appellant, believing that he had a poor case in resisting deportation, had sought to bolster his prospects of success by inventing a false claim and that the Secretary of State was right to conclude that his deportation was necessary as the offences which he had committed were serious and he had been assessed as presenting a medium risk of sexual or violent offending upon his release.\\nOn 4 May 2007 he was moved from HMP Lincoln to Campsfield Immigration Removal Centre.\\nOn 6 July 2007, following a hearing for the reconsideration of his appeals that had been ordered in January 2007, the tribunal refused his appeals following reconsideration.\\nOn 24 August 2007 a deportation order was made and served on the appellant.\\nAs the appellant is a national of Zimbabwe, it is to Zimbabwe that the Secretary of State proposes to deport him.\\nBut two years previously on 4 August 2005 Collins J ordered by consent that removal of 30 Zimbabweans be suspended pending resolution of the issue in a test case, and the enforced return of failed Zimbabwean asylum seekers was suspended by the Secretary of State.\\nThe position as at the date of the hearing of this appeal was that no enforced returns of Zimbabwean failed asylum seekers had taken place since that date.\\nBy a letter dated 8 March 2006 the appellant was informed that he was to be detained and that his detention would be reviewed on a regular basis.\\nIf the reviews had been carried out in accordance with the policy set out in paragraph 38.8 of the manual they would have occurred on 10 March 2006 (after 24 hours), 16 March 2006 (7 days), 23 March 2006 (14 days), 30 March 2006 (21 days) and 6 April 2006 (28 days).\\nThey would have been carried out thereafter at monthly intervals.\\nAs to the monthly reviews, the paragraph 38.8 provides that the first two monthly reviews must be carried out by a Higher Executive Officer, the next two by a Senior Executive Officer or one of Her Majestys Inspectors, the next four by an Assistant Director or Grade 7 civil servant, the next three by a Deputy Director and, in the case of the monthly reviews in the second year of detention, by a Director.\\nBy the date of the hearing before Munby J the appellant had been entitled to 22 monthly reviews of the lawfulness of his detention in addition to the initial five reviews in the first month.\\nIn the event he had had only 10 reviews up to the date of the hearing.\\nOf these, only six were conducted by officials of the required seniority.\\nOf these, two were disavowed by the Secretary of State as flawed by material errors of fact.\\nThe details of the Secretary of States failure to carry out reviews at the required frequency and by the appropriate persons are set in the judgment of Munby J at paras 43 51 and 124 127 and in paras 11 13 of the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\\nThe judge described the picture that emerged from his analysis of the Secretary of States file as deeply disturbing and profoundly shocking.\\nThe Secretary of State has acknowledged that reviews should have been carried out.\\nHe has not sought to justify or excuse in any way their absence in the appellants case.\\nHe also accepts that these failures cannot be extenuated by the appellants own bad character or his previous conduct.\\nIt is now known, following disclosures that were made prior to the hearing of R (WL) Congo v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010] EWCA Civ 111, [2010] 1 WLR 2168 by the Court of Appeal, that from April 2006 to September 2008 the Home Office applied an unpublished detention policy to all foreign national prisoners following the completion of their prison sentences pending their deportation.\\nThis followed the revelation on 25 April 2006 that during the past seven years over 1,000 such prisoners had been released from prison on completion of their sentences without being considered for deportation or deported.\\nIllegal migrants and paedophiles, a toxic mix.\\nThe tabloids will go bananas.\\nThe words of a contemporary diarist, Chris Mullin, Decline and Fall (2010), p 94, capture the atmosphere of disaster that was engendered among ministers by this announcement.\\nA few days later Charles Clarke was removed from his post and was replaced on 4 May 2006 as Home Secretary by Dr John Reid.\\nA practice of blanket detention was then instituted with a ruthless determination that precluded consideration of the merits of any individual case and was wholly at odds with the presumption in the published policy in favour of temporary admission or temporary release.\\nIt remained in place until November 2007 when it was replaced by another unpublished policy which permitted release only in exceptional circumstances.\\nIt was not until 9 September 2008 that a revised detention policy was published.\\nThis course of events may explain the Secretary of States failure to carry out reviews at the required frequency and by the appropriate persons in the appellants case.\\nBut his case has been conducted throughout so far on the basis that the policy that was being applied to him was the published policy.\\nThe new issues that he has raised in light of these disclosures are presently stayed for determination by the High Court: see Laws LJ [2009] 1 WLR 1527, paras 42 44.\\nThe issues\\nMunby J held that the appellant was unlawfully detained for the periods which he specified by reason of the Secretary of States failures to carry out the reviews required by rule 9(1) and the manual.\\nThe basis for that finding is to be found in the following passage in his judgment [2008] EWHC 98 (Admin), para 68: Integral to the scheme endorsed by Parliament in its approval of rule 9(1) of the Detention Centre Rules 2001, and integral to the policy laid down by the Secretary of State in paragraph 38.8 of the Operations Enforcement Manual, is the principle that someone is not to be detained beyond a certain period without there being a review undertaken at regular intervals and moreover, as required by the Secretary of States policy, a review undertaken at increasing high levels of seniority within the Home Office as the period of detention grows.\\nThose reviews are fundamental to the propriety of the continuing detention, they are required in order to ensure that the continuing detention can still be justified in the light of current, and perhaps, changed circumstances, and they are, in my judgment, a necessary prerequisite to the continuing legality of the detention.\\nIn para 122 he said that, to the extent that the appellants detention had been unlawful as a matter of domestic law it had also, by parity of reasoning, been unlawful by virtue of section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998, and that there was nothing in the circumstances of his case to give him a remedy under section 6 where there would not be a remedy under domestic law.\\nSo in practical terms the claim under article 5 of the Convention added nothing.\\nIn the Court of Appeal Laws LJ said that the issue was one of statutory construction: [2009] 1 WLR 1527, para 21.\\nEx p Hardial Singh showed that paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act was subject to implied limitations.\\nThe question, as he saw it, was whether a further limitation was to be found such that on a proper construction of paragraph 2(2) the power was subject to compliance with the rule and the manual: para 23.\\nSummarising his conclusions, with which the other members of the court agreed, he said that compliance with the rules and the manual as such was not a condition precedent to a lawful decision pursuant to paragraph 2(2): para 25.\\nThe statute did not make it so, nor did the common law or the Convention.\\nThe Hardial Singh principles had to be complied with, but this was subject to control by the courts, principally by way of judicial review.\\nIn that event the particular context would be the vindication of those principles, but in this case it was plain that the appellant was held in compliance with them throughout the period of his detention.\\nMr Husain accepted that the Hardial Singh principles had throughout been complied with.\\nOn the other hand there had been repeated failures to comply with the system of review set out in the manual.\\nParagraph 38.8 of the manual states that continued detention in all cases under Immigration Act powers must be subject to administrative review at regular intervals.\\nThese reviews were essential to the continued legality of the exercise by the Secretary of State of his discretion to detain.\\nHe accepted that not all public law errors or policy defaults will render detention unlawful.\\nThe question will always be whether the error is sufficiently linked to the decision to detain or to continue detention.\\nIn this case the reviews required by the policy must be seen as the authority on which continued legality of the detention rests.\\nHe accepted that if his case were to succeed at common law his case under article 5 would not add anything.\\nBut in case it were necessary to address this argument he submitted that the appellant was entitled to the implied protections prescribed by article 5(1)(f).\\nThere had been a clear breach of national procedural rules because the Secretary of State had failed to comply with the rules and with the published policy, which he was required to follow unless there were good reasons not to do so.\\nThis was irrespective of whether the requirements that had been breached were conditions precedent to the exercise of the power to detain.\\nAs to the effect of the decision in Lumba, Mr Husain submitted that it was now clear that it was not a defence for the Secretary of State to show that the detention complied with the Hardial Singh principles and the requirements of the statute.\\nNor was it a defence for him to show that had the public law error not been committed the detainee would have been detained in any event.\\nThe serial failure to conduct the proper detention reviews was a material public law error, as it was essential to the legality of a temporarily unlimited and otherwise unchecked power to continue detention.\\nThe initial detention authority by the Secretary of States executive order was to be contrasted with orders to detain by a court.\\nThe reviews were an important safeguard.\\nThe failure to conduct them amounted, on the facts of this case, to an abuse of the power to detain.\\nFor the Secretary of State Mr Tam accepted that the Hardial Singh principles imposed implied limits on the exercise of the powers of detention that were set out in the statute.\\nBut he submitted that there was no provision or rule that limited the Secretary of States authority to detain in any other way.\\nThings had not been done, probably in violation of his duty in public law, for which legal remedies might have been available.\\nBut the claim in this case was a very specific one.\\nThe question was not whether there had been a breach of the law.\\nThe appellant was seeking damages for false imprisonment.\\nThere was no basis for such a claim, as the detention was at all times within the original authority to detain under the powers that were to be found in the statute.\\nThat would have been plain from the documents that were available in his case had his continued detention had been challenged by judicial review.\\nIn the light of the judgments in Lumba, the central question for the court was whether each relevant breach of the procedural requirement to review detention was material in public law terms, that is to say whether it bore on and was relevant to the decision to detain.\\nThere was a difference between a requirement that was procedural only and a failure to apply a substantive rule which was capable of affecting the decision to detain or not to detain.\\nA pure omission to review detention at the times specified by the policy was not material, at least in a case such as this where, had the review been carried out, the application of the substantive rules would have resulted in a decision to continue detention.\\nBut he accepted that if that submission was rejected, an omission to make a new decision by way of a detention review which was material in the Lumba sense must inevitably have the effect that the next period of detention was not authorised and the tort of false imprisonment was made out.\\nThe common law remedy\\nThe issue as to whether the appellant is entitled to damages, as focussed by these arguments, is a narrow one.\\nIt is common ground that the appellant was lawfully detained at the outset, as his detention was with a view to the making of a deportation order.\\nThere was a serious breakdown thereafter in the system of reviews mandated by the manual.\\nBut it is also common ground, as the judge found, that the Hardial Singh principles were complied with throughout the entire period.\\nAs Mr Tam points out, the continued detention could at all times have been justified by the Secretary of State had he been faced with an application for judicial review.\\nUntil 24 August 2007, when the deportation order was made and served on the appellant, the appellant was being detained under paragraph 2(2) pending the making of a deportation order.\\nFrom that date onwards he was being detained under paragraph 2(3) because he had not been released on bail and the Secretary of State had not directed otherwise.\\nOn the other hand Mr Tam accepts that the breakdown in the system was a breach of a duty owed by the Secretary of State to the appellant in public law.\\nThe appellant could have obtained a mandatory order at any time requiring the reviews to be carried out if he had asked for this.\\nThe focus of attention therefore is on the authority to detain.\\nIs the review essential to the legality of the continued detention? Or is it a sufficient answer to the claim for damages for the Secretary of State to say that, unless and until he directed otherwise, the authority to detain is there throughout in terms of the statute? I have not found this an easy question to answer.\\nI do not accept the Court of Appeals view that the question is one of statutory construction.\\nWe are dealing in this case with what the Secretary of State agrees are public law duties which are not set out in the statute.\\nOf course it is for the courts, not the Secretary of State, to say what the effect of the statements in the manual actually is.\\nBut there is a substantial body of authority to the effect that under domestic public law the Secretary of State is generally obliged to follow his published detention policy.\\nIn R (Saadi) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2001] EWCA Civ 1512, [2002] 1 WLR 356, para 7, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers MR, delivering the judgment of the court, said that lawful exercise of statutory powers can be restricted, according to established principles of public law, by government policy and the legitimate expectation to which such policy gives rise.\\nIn Nadarajah v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003] EWCA Civ 1768, [2004] INLR 139, para 54 the Master of the Rolls, again delivering the judgment of the court, said: Our domestic law comprehends both the provisions of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971 and the Secretary of States published policy, which, under principles of public law, he is obliged to follow.\\nIn D v Home Office (Bail for Immigration Detainees intervening) [2005] EWCA Civ 38, [2006] 1 WLR 1003, para 132 Brooke LJ said that what the law requires is that the policies for administrative detention are published and that immigration officers do not stray outside the four corners of those policies when taking decisions in individual cases.\\nWade and Forsyth, Administrative Law 10th ed, (2009), pp 315 316 states that the principle that policy must be consistently applied is not in doubt and that the courts now expect government departments to honour their statements of policy.\\nPolicy is not law, so it may be departed from if a good reason can be shown.\\nBut it has not been suggested that there was a good reason for the failure of officials of the required seniority to review the detention in this case and to do so in accordance with the prescribed timetable.\\nMr Husain submitted that the effect of the statements in the manual was not just to create a legitimate expectation that the reviews would be carried out.\\nHe said that, as the discretion to detain under the statute had to be exercised reasonably according to the Hardial Singh principles, the authority for continued detention was dependent on decisions taken each time it was reviewed.\\nMoreover an unlawful detention was not rendered lawful because there were circumstances that might have made it lawful.\\nHe sought support for that proposition in Clarke LJs observation in Roberts v Chief Constable of the Cheshire Constabulary [1999] 1 WLR 662, 666, that the detention in that case was unlawful because it was not reviewed until some event occurred to make it lawful.\\nBut that was a case where the plaintiff was detained under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, section 34(1) of which provided that a person arrested for an offence shall not be kept in detention except in accordance with the provisions of Part IV of the Act.\\nSection 40, which was in Part IV, required reviews of the detention of person police custody at stated intervals.\\nIt was clear, as Clarke LJ said in the passage at p 666 that Mr Husain referred to, that the plaintiff was not being detained in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Act.\\nAs Mr Husain pointed out, the Secretary of State accepts that where the authorising statute provides that a particular procedural step is a precondition to the legality of the detention a failure to carry out the required step means that the detention is unlawful and entitles the detainee to damages for false imprisonment.\\nThat is what was decided in Roberts v Chief Constable of the Cheshire Constabulary [1999] 1 WLR 662.\\nBut that case, as Mr Tam put it, was all about the statute.\\nThe situation in this case is quite different, as there is no mention of the need for reviews in relevant paragraphs in the authorising statute.\\nI agree with both Laws LJ in the Court of Appeal, para 25, and Lord Brown (see para 100, below), that Roberts provides little, if any, assistance on the effect of the Secretary of States failure to comply with his published policy.\\nOn the other hand the appellants argument that where the published policy is departed from the detention is unlawful finds some support in Nadarajah v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] INLR 139.\\nTwo appeals were before the court in that case.\\nThe appellants had both been detained on the ground that their removal from the United Kingdom was imminent.\\nThe Secretary of States published policy was not to treat removal as imminent once proceedings which challenged the right to remove had been initiated.\\nIt was also the policy of the immigration service when considering the imminence of removal to disregard information from those acting for asylum seekers that proceedings were about to be initiated.\\nBut this policy had not been made public and it was held that the Secretary of State could not rely on it.\\nIn para 54 the Master of the Rolls, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, said that he was obliged to follow his published policy.\\nAsking itself the question whether the appellants detention had been lawful, the court held that it was not.\\nIn para 68, referring to Nadarajahs case, Lord Phillips said: The only basis upon which the Immigration Service could treat his removal as imminent was by applying that aspect of the Secretary of States policy which had not been made public, namely that no regard would be paid to an intimation that judicial review proceedings would be instituted.\\nThe Secretary of State cannot rely upon this aspect of his policy as rendering lawful that which was, on the face of it, at odds with his policy, as made public.\\nIn other words, it was unlawful for him to depart from his published policy unless there were good reasons for doing so.\\nIn para 72, referring to the case of the other appellant, he said that his detention was unlawful for the same reason as Nadarajahs detention was unlawful.\\nIn consequence of that decision he was entitled to damages: see para 15.\\nIn Mohammed Holgate v Duke [1984] AC 437, 443, Lord Diplock said that the Wednesbury principles are applicable not only in proceedings for judicial review but also for the purpose of founding a cause of action at common law for trespass by false imprisonment.\\nIt may be that not every public law error will justify resort to the common law remedy in every case.\\nBut I do not think that it is necessary to show that there was bad faith or that the discretion was exercised for an improper purpose in the present context.\\nWhere there is an executive discretion to detain someone without limit of time, the right to liberty demands that the cause of action should be available if the discretion has not been lawfully exercised.\\nIn R v Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison, Ex p Hague [1992] 1 AC 58 Lord Bridge of Harwich said that the tort of false imprisonment has two ingredients: the fact of imprisonment and the absence of lawful authority to justify it.\\nThe requirements of the 1971 Act and Hardial Singh principles are not the only applicable law with which the Secretary of State must comply.\\nNadarajahs case shows that lawful authority for an executive power of detention may also be absent when there is a departure from the executives published policy.\\nAs Lord Brown points out, the published policy in Nadarajahs case entitled the detainee to release because it narrowed the grounds on which the power of detention was exercisable: para 107, below.\\nIn this case the policy was different because it was concerned not with the grounds for detention but with procedure.\\nAll it did was to provide that the detention would be reviewed by designated officers at regular intervals.\\nOf course I agree with him that the policies are different.\\nBut I do not think that this difference means that Nadarajah offers no assistance in this case.\\nOn the contrary, it seems to me to indicate that a failure by the executive to adhere to its published policy without good reason can amount to an abuse of power which renders the detention itself unlawful.\\nI use this expression to describe a breach of public law which bears directly on the discretionary power that the executive is purporting to exercise.\\nThe importance of the principle that the executive must act within the law was emphasised by Lord Bingham in his seminal Sir David Williams lecture, The Rule of Law [2007] CLJ 67, 72, when he said: The broader and more loosely textured a discretion is, whether conferred on an official or a judge, the greater the scope for subjectivity and hence for arbitrariness, which is the antithesis of the rule of law.\\nThis sub rule requires that a discretion should ordinarily be narrowly defined and its exercise capable of reasoned justification.\\nThat is a proposition which can be applied to this case.\\nThe published policy narrowed the power of executive detention by requiring that it be reviewed regularly.\\nThis was necessary to meet the objection that, unless it was implemented in accordance with a published policy, the power of executive detention was being applied in a manner that was arbitrary.\\nSo it was an abuse of the power for the detainee to be detained without his detention being reviewed at regular intervals.\\nApplying the test proposed by Lord Dyson in Lumba, it was an error which bore on and was relevant to the decision to detain throughout the period when the reviews should have been carried out: [2011] 2 WLR 671, para 68.\\nThe authorities relied on by the Secretary of State\\nMr Tam referred to a series of cases where detention was held not to be unlawful despite errors of public law.\\nIn R v Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison, Ex p Hague [1992] 1 AC 58 the appellant Hague had been segregated under a procedure which was not lawful which it was claimed amounted to false imprisonment, and another prisoner named Weldon claimed that he had been falsely imprisoned and battered by certain prison officers.\\nThose claims were rejected, in short because the sentence of imprisonment provided lawful authority for the prisoners detention, that this could not be read as subject to any implied term with respect to the prison rules and that an otherwise lawful detention was not rendered unlawful by the conditions of detention.\\nMr Tam said that it was authority for the view that a public law error made in relation to a persons detention may entitle the person to seek judicial review but does not necessarily give rise to a remedy in damages.\\nI would not quarrel with that proposition, but it begs the question whether the present case is one where a remedy in damages is available.\\nCullen v Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary [2003] UKHL 39, [2003] 1 WLR 1763 was a case about the right of access to a solicitor.\\nThe appellant was arrested under section 14(1)(b) of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1982.\\nHe asked to see a solicitor but his right to do so was deferred while he was in police custody.\\nIn contravention of the relevant statute the deferral was made before the appellant requested access and he was not given the reasons for delaying access.\\nHe claimed damages for false imprisonment.\\nLord Hutton said in para 48 that he saw no substance in this submission as he had been lawfully arrested and after his arrest was lawfully detained under the provisions of the statute.\\nThe premature authorisation and the breach of the requirement for reasons to be given did not render the detention unlawful.\\nLord Millett said in para 61 that compliance was not a condition of lawful detention.\\nThis decision indicates that the critical question is likely to be whether breaches of this kind undermine the lawful authority for the detention.\\nOn the view that was taken of the statute that applied in that case, they did not.\\nThe facts of this case, which concerns the Secretary of States discretion to maintain detention in accordance with his published policy, are quite different.\\nIn R (Saadi) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2002] UKHL 41, [2002] 1 WLR 3131, which was concerned with the lawfulness of detention under paragraphs 2(1) and 16(1) of Schedule 2 to the 1971 Act, Lord Slynn of Hadley said at para 48 that the Secretary of States giving of no or wrong reasons did not affect the legality of the detention.\\nMr Tam said that no hint was given in that case that this failure gave rise to a problem as to its legality.\\nBut Collins J said that it was not argued in that case that the muddle about reasons rendered the decision to detain unlawful: [2001] EWCA Civ 1512, [2002] 1 WLR 356, para 16.\\nNor was the effect of a failure to review in issue.\\nIn R (Munjaz) v Mersey Care NHS Trust [2003] EWCA Civ 1036, [2004] QB 395 two psychiatric patients challenged the lawfulness of the policy on seclusion that was applied in their respective hospitals.\\nReferring to what was decided in R v Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison, Ex p Hague [1992] 1 AC 58, Hale LJ said that a person who had been deprived of his liberty in pursuance of a lawful power to detain cannot through the medium of a tort of false imprisonment complain about the conditions in which he is detained, at least by those who are lawfully detaining him: para 49.\\nThere had been a breach of the statutory code of practice, but this did not amount to false imprisonment: para 82.\\nMr Tam said that these observations supported his argument.\\nBut he accepts that Hague, Cullen and Munjaz were not concerned with the question whether the person concerned should be detained at all, but only with the conditions of detention (Hague and Munjaz) or the ancillary matter of legal advice while in detention (Cullen).\\nIt should also be noted that in Munjaz, para 77, Hale LJ said that if an individual decision has been taken unlawfully in public law terms and results in actions which are tortious if taken without lawful excuse, then tortious remedies will be available.\\nThe context is different, of course.\\nAnd the claim for a remedy under the tort of false imprisonment was rejected.\\nBut her observation is entirely consistent with what was said in Nadarajah v Secretary of State for the Home Department: see para 39, above.\\nThe question as to the lawfulness of continued detention was directly in issue in R (Walker) v Secretary of State for Justice (Parole Board intervening) [2009] UKHL 22, [2010] 1 AC 553.\\nThat case arose out of the Secretary of States failure to provide the systems and resources that prisoners serving indeterminate sentences for public protection needed to demonstrate to the Parole Board by the time of the expiry of their tariff periods that it was not longer necessary for the protection of the public for them to remain in detention.\\nThere was a breach of the Secretary of States public law duty to provide these facilities.\\nBut, as I noted in para 5, counsel for the prisoners accepted that they were unable to challenge the legality of the warrant which authorised their continued detention.\\nThat provides the context for the passage in the speech of Lord Brown of Eaton under Heywood in paras 36 and 37 on which Mr Tam relies, where he said: 36.\\nIt is one thing to say as indeed is now undisputed that the Secretary of State was in breach (even systemic breach) of his public law duty to provide such courses as would enable IPP prisoners to demonstrate their safety for release and, to some extent at least, course enabling them to reduce the risk they pose, duties inherent in the legislation (the legislations underlying premise as Laws LJ described it [2008] 1 All ER 138, paras 24, 50); quite another to say that such breach of duty results in detention being unlawful.\\nI respectfully agree with the Court of Appeal that it does not. 37.\\nThe remedy for such breach of public law duty indeed the only remedy, inadequate in certain respects it may be is declaratory relief condemning the Secretary of States failures and indicating that he is obliged to do more Past failures do not sound in\\ndamages\\nIn my own speech in Walker, para 6, I said that in terms of the statute the detention was lawful until the Parole board gave a direction for the prisoners release.\\nThe default position was that until the direction was given the protection of the public required that the prisoner should be confined.\\nI do not think that Lord Browns observations can be applied to the different statutory regime that we are concerned with it this case.\\nI agree with him that Walker is no more helpful to the respondents case than Roberts is to the appellant: para 104, below.\\nFor the same reason I do not think that the decision in Dunn v Parole Board [2008] EWCA Civ 374, [2009] 1 WLR 728, where the Court of Appeal applied the same approach where the Parole Board had failed to conduct a timely review and the appellant remained in detention as authorised by the statute, is of any assistance in this case.\\nDiscussion\\nI cannot find in these authorities anything that requires us to hold that the claim for damages for false imprisonment is untenable or which points conclusively in the other direction.\\nI would start therefore with principle that must lie at the heart of any discussion as to whether a persons detention can be justified.\\nThe liberty of the subject can be interfered with only upon grounds that the court will uphold as lawful: R v Governor of Brockhill Prison, Ex p Evans (No 2) [2001] 2 AC 19, 35; see also Tam Te Lam v Superintendent of Tai A Chau Detention Centre [1997] AC 97, per Lord Browne Wilkinson at p 111B.\\nIn Ex p Evans (No 2), p 42, Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough said: Imprisonment involves the infringement of a legally protected right and therefore must be justified.\\nIf it cannot be lawfully justified, it is no defence for the defendant to say that he believed that he could justify it.\\nWe are dealing in this case with the power of executive detention under the 1971 Act.\\nIt depends on the exercise of a discretion, not on a warrant for detention issued by any court.\\nThat is why the manner of its exercise was so carefully qualified by Woolf J in Hardial Singh.\\nThe power to detain must be exercised reasonably and in a manner which is not arbitrary.\\nIf it is not, the detention cannot be lawfully justified.\\nThe initial decision to detain will be held to be lawful if it is made under the authority of the Secretary of State pending the making of a deportation order.\\nBut it cannot be asserted, in the light of what was said in Hardial Singh, that the initial decision renders continued and indefinite detention lawful until the deportation order is made whatever the circumstances.\\nNor can it be said that it has that effect after the deportation order is made pending the persons removal from the United Kingdom when the person is being detained under paragraph 2(3).\\nThe authority that stems from the initial decision is not unqualified.\\nThe question then is what is to be made of the Secretary of States public law duty to give effect to his published policy.\\nIn my opinion the answer to that question will always be fact sensitive.\\nIn this case we are dealing with an executive act which interferes with personal liberty.\\nSo one must ask whether the published policy is sufficiently closely related to the authority to detain to provide a further qualification of the discretion that he has under the statute.\\nUnlike the 2001 Rules, chapter 38 of the manual is concerned with the lawfulness of the detention.\\nThat is made clear in the opening paragraphs: see para 18, above.\\nIt has been designed to give practical effect to the Hardial Singh principles to meet the requirement that, to be lawful, the measures taken must be transparent and not arbitrary.\\nIt contains a set of instructions with which officials are expected to comply: see Schedule 2 to the 1971 Act, para 1(3).\\nAs I see it, the principles and the instructions in the manual go hand in hand.\\nAs Munby J said in para 68, the reviews are fundamental to the propriety of continued detention.\\nThe instructions are the means by which, in accordance with his published policy, the Secretary of State gives effect to the principles.\\nThey are not only commendable; they are necessary.\\nThe relationship of the review to the exercise of the authority is very close.\\nThey too go hand in hand.\\nIf the system works as it should, authorisation for continued detention is to be found in the decision taken at each review.\\nReferences to the authority to detain in the forms that were issued in the appellants case illustrate this point.\\nForm IS 151F, which is headed Monthly Progress Report to Detainees, concludes at the top of page 3 of 3 with the words Authority to maintain detention given, on which the officers comments are invited and beneath which his decision is recorded.\\nThe discretion to continue detention must, of course, be exercised in accordance with the principles.\\nBut it must also be exercised in accordance with the policy stated in the manual.\\nThe timetable which paragraph 38.8 sets out is an essential part of the process.\\nThese are limitations on the way the discretion may be exercised.\\nFollowing the guidance that Nadarajah v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] INLR 139 provides (see paras 39 and 40, above), I would hold that if they are breached without good reason continued detention is unlawful.\\nIn principle it must follow that tortious remedies will be available, including the remedy of damages.\\nThere remains however the question of causation: what if the Secretary of State is able to show that, despite the failure to give effect to the policy, continued detention was nevertheless compatible with the Hardial Singh principles? Is it an answer for the Secretary of State to say that, as he could have authorised continued detention had lawful procedures been followed, no tort was committed? Is there room in such a situation for an award of damages?\\nThese questions are brought into sharp focus in this case.\\nMr Husain accepts that the Secretary of State would have been able to justify the need for the appellants detention under the Hardial Singh principles at all times had he been required to do so.\\nBut in Roberts v Chief Constable of the Cheshire Constabulary [1999] 1 WLR 662, 667, Clarke LJ said that it was nothing to the point to say that the detention would have been lawful if a review had been carried out or that there were grounds which would have justified detention.\\nThe statutory requirement with which he was dealing in that case existed in order to ensure that members of the public were not detained except in certain defined circumstances.\\nIn all other circumstances, he said, every member of the public is entitled to his liberty.\\nI would apply that reasoning to this case.\\nIt is true that the reviews were not required by the statute.\\nBut there was a public law duty to give effect to the provisions about reviews in the manual.\\nIf the reviews were not carried out unless for good reason, which is not suggested in this case continued detention was not authorised by the initial decision to detain.\\nIt is no defence for the Secretary of State to say that there were good grounds for detaining the appellant anyway.\\nUnless the authority to detain was renewed under the powers conferred by the statute he was entitled to his liberty.\\nThe decision in Lumba leads inevitably to this conclusion.\\nAs for the question of damages, the decision on this point in Lumba was that the appellants were entitled to no more than nominal damages as their detention was at all times justifiable.\\nBut this cannot be assumed to be so in every case, and in this case the facts have still to be established.\\nSo I would not foreclose entirely the possibility that the appellant in this case is entitled to more than a purely nominal award.\\nThe public law duty exists for the protection of everyone, from the most undeserving to the most vulnerable.\\nThe detention of children, those suffering from physical or mental illness and those who have been traumatised by torture are perhaps the most obvious examples.\\nParagraph 38.8 states that children are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that the decision to detain is based on the current circumstances of the case and that detention remains appropriate.\\nThis sentence makes explicit in the case of children what must be taken to be the purpose of the reviews in all cases.\\nThe difference is that the system provides for more frequent reviews in the case of children.\\nIn any event, false imprisonment is a trespass against the person which is actionable without proof of special damage: Murray v Ministry of Defence [1988] 1 WLR 692, 701 702, per Lord Griffiths; Roberts v Chief Constable of the Cheshire Constabulary [1999] 1 WLR 662, 666 669, per Lord Clarke.\\nThere may well be issues as to quantum in cases of that kind.\\nAs Smith LJ said in Iqbal v Prison Officers Association [2009] EWCA Civ 1312, [2010] QB 732, para 83, an award of damages for false imprisonment is based on normal compensatory principles: see also Langley v Liverpool City Council [2005] EWCA Civ 1173, [2006] 1 WLR 375, para 70.\\nIt may be that the conclusion in this case will be that an award of nominal damages is all that is needed to recognise that the appellants fundamental rights have been breached.\\nBut that does not affect the issue of principle.\\nI would hold therefore that the appellant is entitled to the remedy he seeks at common law.\\nThere will, of course, have to be an inquiry as to the quantum of damages if the amount is not agreed.\\nArticle 5\\nThe appellants alternative claim is that he has an enforceable right to compensation under article 5(5) of the Convention.\\nHe maintains that his detention did not satisfy the requirements of article 5(1)(f).\\nIt was not lawful, and it was not in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law.\\nHe relies on what the Grand Chamber said in Saadi v United Kingdom (2008) 47 EHRR 17, para 74, and in A v United Kingdom (2009) 49 EHRR 29; Application No 3455/05, 19 February 2009, para 164 as to what was needed to avoid the detention being branded as arbitrary.\\nThe protections referred to in these passages are, as Mr Husain points out, redolent of the Hardial Singh principles.\\nIt is agreed on both sides that the article 5 claim adds nothing to the claim at common law if that claim succeeds: see R (I) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003] INLR 196, per Simon Brown LJ at para 8; R (Munjaz) v Mersey Care NHS Trust [2004] 2 QB 395, per Hale LJ at para 70.\\nIndeed there are reasons for thinking that the Hardial Singh principles are in some respects more favourable to detainees than Strasbourg requires, as Lord Brown indicates: see para 94, below; Chahal v United Kingdom (1996) 23 EHRR 413, para 112; Saadi v United Kingdom, para 72.\\nSo, as I would hold that the appellant succeeds on his common law claim, I propose to say no more about this alternative, except to note that article 5(5) gives a right to compensation where there has been a contravention of any of the provisions of the article.\\nThis would have provided the appellant with a remedy if, although there was a breach of the public law duty to conduct reviews, he was not entitled to claim damages at common law for false imprisonment.\\nAs it is, for the reasons I have given, I consider that he is entitled to that remedy and at least to nominal damages.\\nConclusion\\nFor these reasons, and for those given by Lady Hale and Lord Kerr with which I am in full agreement, I would allow the appeal.\\nI would restore the declaration that was made by Munby J that the appellants detention by the Secretary of State was unlawful for the periods stated by him, except for a period of one month beginning on 6 December 2007 when the only defect in the decision to continue detention was that the review was carried out by an official of the wrong grade: see R (Lumba v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] 2 WLR 671, para 68 per Lord Dyson.\\nI would also restore his orders as to the assessment, if the parties are not agreed, of the quantum of damages.\\nLADY HALE\\nMr Shepherd Kambadzi may not be a very nice person.\\nHe is certainly not a very good person.\\nHe has overstayed his welcome in this country for many years.\\nHe has abused our hospitality by committing assaults and sexual assault.\\nIt is not surprising that the Home Secretary wishes to deport him.\\nBut in R (Roberts) v Parole Board [2005] UKHL 45, [2005] 2 AC 738, para 84, Lord Steyn quoted the well known remark of Justice Frankfurter in United States v Rabinowitz (1950) 339 US 56, p 69, that It is a fair summary of history to say that the safeguards of liberty have frequently been forged in controversies involving not very nice people.\\nLord Steyn continued: Even the most wicked of men are entitled to justice at the hands of the state.\\nAnd I doubt whether Mr Kambadzi is the most wicked of men.\\nHe had come to the end of the time he was due to serve as a result of his crimes.\\nHe may even have been expecting to be released from prison on 8 March 2006.\\nIf so, it must have come as a cruel shock when he was kept in prison (indeed for many months in the same prison where he had been serving his sentence), because the Home Secretary had decided to make a deportation order against him and at the same time to exercise the power to authorise his detention under paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 3 to the Immigration Act 1971.\\nThis gives the Secretary of State an apparently open ended power to authorise the detention of a person who has been served with a notice of intention to deport pending the making of the deportation order.\\nThe order was in fact made more than a year later, after which Mr Kambadzi was detained under paragraph 2(3) of the Schedule, which again gives an apparently open ended power to authorise detention pending his removal or departure from the United Kingdom.\\nNo court had ordered or authorised or approved this detention.\\nThe trial judge who sentenced Mr Kambadzi for his crimes had not even recommended it.\\nA Government official decided to lock him up, on the face of it until a Government official decided to take the next step.\\nBut no one suggests that paragraph 2 of Schedule 3 gives the Government an unlimited power to authorise a persons indefinite detention without trial.\\nEveryone knows that there are limits.\\nEveryone also knows that if those limits are exceeded, the detention becomes unlawful.\\nEveryone also knows that a person who is unlawfully detained is entitled, not only to be released, but to claim compensation for having been unlawfully detained.\\nThe person responsible for the unlawful detention is liable even if he acted in good faith and without any negligence: see R v Governor of Brockhill Prison, Ex p Evans (No 2) [2001] 2 AC 19 (compare the statutory protection given to those who detain mentally disordered or incapacitated people under the Mental Health Act 1983 or the Mental Capacity Act 2005: see s 139(1) and Schedule A1, para 3 respectively).\\nAll this is Hornbook law.\\nThe only question, therefore, is what the limits are to the Home Secretarys powers.\\nIn particular, are there procedural as well as substantive limits? The substantive limits were established as long ago as 1983, in the powerful extempore judgment of Woolf J in R v Governor of Durham Prison, Ex p Hardial Singh [1984] 1 WLR 704, and approved by the Privy Council in Tan Te Lam v Superintendent of the Tai A Chau Detention Centre [1997] AC 97.\\nThe detention has to be pending the deportation order or the removal, as the case may be, and cannot therefore be imposed for any other purpose.\\nIf it becomes clear that the purpose cannot be carried out, the detention becomes unlawful.\\nIn Tan Te Lam, above, the detention of these particular Vietnamese boat people became unlawful once it was clear that the Vietnamese Government did not regard them as Vietnamese nationals and would not have them back.\\nIt was also held in Hardial Singh that the Secretary of State cannot detain a person for longer than is reasonable in all the circumstances.\\nThis can depend upon the reasons for the delay.\\nThe Secretary of State has to exercise all reasonable expedition to ensure that the steps are taken which will be necessary to ensure the removal of the individual within a reasonable time: Hardial Singh, at p 706F.\\nIf the Secretary of State is dragging his feet, then the period may become unreasonable.\\nBut if the detainee is unjustifiably stringing things out, for example by launching an obviously bogus asylum claim, it will not.\\nIn this case, Munby J held that the Home Secretary did indeed intend to deport Mr Kambadzi and that this was still a possibility.\\nHe had been detained for a very long time (22 months by the time that Munby J decided the case in January 2008).\\nBut for most of that time he had been pursuing a claim for asylum, which was clearly bogus, through all possible appellate routes.\\nThereafter he could not be deported because the Home Secretary had temporarily suspended removals to Zimbabwe.\\nBut there remained some prospect of achieving this.\\nHence the detention was substantively justified in accordance with the Hardial Singh principles.\\nBut Munby J held that the detention had, for much of those 22 months, been unlawful because of the failure of the Secretary of States officials to conduct the regular reviews laid down in his own Operations Enforcement Manual.\\nNo one doubts that the failure to conduct these reviews was unlawful, and that the Secretary of State could have been obliged by judicial review proceedings to comply with his stated policy, unless he had a good reason not to do so in the individual case: see the Court of Appeals judgment in this case at [2009] EWCA Civ 1204, [2009] 1 WLR 1527, para 25.\\nThe issue is whether that unlawful failure has also rendered the detention unlawful.\\nThe Manual seemed to think that it did.\\nIt stated that the purpose of the reviews was to ensure that the detention continued to be justified: see para 38.3.4.\\nFurther than that, it declared, at para 38.1: To be lawful, detention must not only be based on one of the statutory powers and accord with the limitations implied by domestic and Strasbourg case law but must also accord with this stated policy.\\nThe Court of Appeal took the same view in Nadarajah v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003] EWCA Civ 1768, [2004] INLR 139.\\nAt para 54, Lord Phillips stated that: Our domestic law comprehends both the provisions of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971 and the Secretary of States published policy, which, under principles of public law, he is obliged to follow.\\nThe failure to follow that published policy rendered the detentions unlawful in that case.\\nThe policy which was in question there related to the considerations that the Secretary of State would take into account in deciding to detain.\\nIt went further than the bare bones of the Hardial Singh principles.\\nNadarajah was a case principally brought under article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\\nThe question, therefore, was whether the detention was lawful in the sense that it complied with the Convention standards of legality.\\nIt is not surprising that the Court held that, to be lawful, a decision to detain had to comply, not only with the statute, but also with the Secretary of States published policy.\\nBut it is also not surprising that the majority of this Court has now held, in R (Lumba and Mighty) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 12; [2011] 2 WLR 671, that a failure to comply with the Secretary of States published policy may also render detention unlawful for the purpose of the tort of false imprisonment.\\nWhile accepting that not every failure to comply with a published policy will render the detention unlawful, I remain of the view that the breach of public law duty must be material to the decision to detain and not to some other aspect of the detention and it must be capable of affecting the result which is not the same as saying that the result would have been different had there been no breach (see the Lumba case, para 207).\\nThe question remains, however, whether a material breach of a public law duty to conduct regular reviews that is, a procedural obligation has the same consequence as a material breach of a public law duty to detain only if certain criteria are fulfilled.\\nFor the sake of the argument before this Court, we have to assume that the case falls into the former category breach of a procedural obligation even though the co incidence of timing and the evidence of the secret policy which emerged in Lumba might suggest that the real reason why the reviews were not conducted as required by the policy was that they would be a waste of time all these people were going to be detained under the new and secret criteria in any event.\\nBut might there be a distinction between the substantive limitations on the power to detain and the procedural requirements for exercising it?\\nSometimes a statute puts the effect of a failure to follow procedural requirements beyond doubt.\\nThe Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, section 34(1), states that A person . shall not be kept in police detention except in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Act; those provisions require regular reviews; failure to conduct those reviews on time renders detention beyond the time when they should have been conducted unlawful: see Roberts v Chief Constable of the Cheshire Constabulary [1999] 1 WLR 662, CA.\\nSometimes a statute does not say in so many words that failing to comply with one of its procedural requirements will render the resulting detention unlawful, but the courts will construe the statute to mean that it does.\\nAn example is the prohibition in the Mental Health Act 1983, section 11(4)(a), of making an application for compulsory admission to hospital if the patients nearest relative objects: Re S C (Mental Patient: Habeas Corpus) [1996] QB 599, CA.\\nIn these cases, it is irrelevant that the person concerned could have been lawfully detained had the correct procedures been followed.\\nSometimes, however, the court will conclude that the lawfulness of detention does not depend upon the fulfilment of a particular statutory requirement.\\nFor example, in R (D) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2006] EWHC 980 (Admin), it was common ground that failing to comply with the requirement in the (Immigration) Detention Centre Rules 2001 SI 2001/238 that immigration detainees be given a medical examination within 24 hours of arrival did not render the detention unlawful unless the detainees could show that it would have led to their earlier release.\\nIn short, there are some procedural requirements, failure to comply with which renders the detention unlawful irrespective of whether or not the substantive grounds for detention exist, and some procedural requirements, failure to follow which does not have this effect.\\nIf the requirement is laid down in legislation, it will be a matter of statutory construction into which category it falls.\\nA clear distinction can be drawn between a requirement which goes to whether or not a person is detained and a requirement which goes to the conditions under which a person is detained.\\nIf the grounds exist for detaining a person in a mental hospital, for example, and the procedures have been properly followed, it is not unlawful to detain him in conditions of greater security than are in fact required by the nature and degree of his mental disorder.\\nThe same analysis applies to requirements which are imposed, not by statute, but by the common law.\\nThere are some procedural requirements which go to the legality of the detention itself and some which do not.\\nThe common law imposed a requirement that an arrested person be told, at the time, the real reason why he was being arrested.\\nIt did so for the very good reason that the arrested person had to know whether or not he was entitled to resist arrest.\\nMr Leachinsky was told that he was being arrested under the Liverpool Corporation Act 1921, but this Act gave the police officers no power to arrest him without a warrant.\\nThey did have power to arrest him on reasonable suspicion of having committed a felony.\\nBut, as they had not told him this, his detention was unlawful and he was entitled to damages for false imprisonment: see Christie v Leachinsky [1947] AC 573.\\nAs Lord Simonds put it, at p 592, if a man is to be deprived of his freedom he is entitled to know the reason why.\\nIt is not statute, but the common law, indeed the rule of law itself, which imposes upon the Secretary of State the duty to comply with his own stated policy, unless he has a good reason to depart from it in the particular case at the particular time.\\nSome parts of the policy in question are not directly concerned with the justification and procedure for the detention and have more to do with its quality or conditions.\\nBut the whole point of the regular reviews is to ensure that the detention is lawful.\\nThat is not surprising.\\nIt was held in Tan Te Lam, above, that the substantive limits on the power to detain were jurisdictional facts, so the Secretary of State has to be in a position to prove these if need be.\\nHe will not be able to do so unless he has kept the case under review.\\nHe himself has decided how often this needs to be done.\\nUnless and until he changes his mind, the detainees are entitled to hold him to that.\\nJust as Mr Leachinskys detention was unlawful even though there were in fact good grounds for arresting him, the detainees detention is unlawful during the periods when it has not been reviewed in accordance with the policy, irrespective of whether or not the review would have led to their release.\\nIn my view, Munby J was right to hold that the reviews were fundamental to the propriety of the continuing detention and a necessary prerequisite to the continuing legality of the detention: see [2008] EWHC 98 (Admin), para 68.\\nIt follows also, from the decision in Lumba, that the fact if it be a fact that had the requisite reviews been held, the decision would have been the same makes no difference.\\nHowever, the result of any review, had it been held, cannot be irrelevant to the quantum of damages to which the detainee may be entitled.\\nFalse imprisonment is a trespass to the person and therefore actionable per se, without proof of loss or damage.\\nBut that does not affect the principle that the defendant is only liable to pay substantial damages for the loss and damage which his wrongful act has caused.\\nThe amount of compensation to which a person is entitled must be affected by whether he would have suffered the loss and damage had things been done as they should have been done.\\nA differently constituted majority in Lumba has now clearly rejected the view, taken by some members of the Court, that deliberate breaches of constitutional rights might attract a conventional sum in vindicatory damages even if the officials conduct were not so egregious as to attract exemplary or punitive damages.\\nThat view has, of course, to be respected.\\nI have reached these conclusions without reference to the Strasbourg case law under article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\\nI did initially think that article 5 might supply the answer to what, on any view, is not an easy question.\\nArticle 5 lays down an exhaustive list of the circumstances in which a person may be deprived of his liberty.\\nThese include, in article 5(1)(f), the lawful arrest or detention of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition.\\nThe requirement of lawfulness is not limited to complying with the substantive and procedural provisions of the domestic law.\\nThe Convention itself imports extra requirements in order to ensure that the detention is not arbitrary.\\nSome of these are procedural.\\nThus the detention of persons of unsound mind under article 5(1)(e), even if formally authorised, must be regularly reviewed in order to ensure that the criteria for detention still exist: see X v United Kingdom (1982) 4 EHRR 118.\\nA principle of domestic law which allows people to be de facto detained without any formality at all contravenes article 5(1)(e) (as well as article 5(4)) even though the criteria for detention do exist: see HL v United Kingdom (2005) 40 EHRR 761.\\nThe Strasbourg court has not yet (so far as we are aware) addressed the procedural protection which may be required in order to prevent detention by the executive under article 5(1)(f) becoming arbitrary.\\nThe notion of arbitrariness for the purpose of article 5(1)(f) is, however, different from the notion of arbitrariness for the purpose of article 5(1)(b), (d) and (e).\\nIt does not require that the detention be necessary in order to achieve the stated aim: see Chahal v United Kingdom (1997) 23 EHRR 413; Saadi v United Kingdom (2008) 47 EHRR 427.\\nBut in Chahal, the Court did endorse the Hardial Singh principles, which incorporate a reasonable time limit on the detention.\\nIt is not impossible, therefore, that the Court would also impose a requirement for regular reviews.\\nBut it cannot be assumed that it would do so, or that it would expect these to be as rigorous as those which the Secretary of State has imposed upon himself.\\nThus, while the article 5 jurisprudence does not detract from the conclusions reached on domestic law, it does not add anything to them.\\nFor those reasons, I would allow the appeal and make the order proposed by Lord Hope, although I would not hold out much hope that Mr Kambadzi will be entitled to more than a nominal sum in damages.\\nMy reasons for reaching this conclusion are, I believe, no different from those of Lord Hope and Lord Kerr.\\nBut because the Court is so narrowly divided, I thought it necessary to reason the matter through for myself.\\nThe decision in Lumba has confirmed and strengthened me in these conclusions, although I acknowledge that, as this case was presented to us, the departure from published departmental policy was of a different kind from the departure in that case.\\nNevertheless, it was so obvious and so persistent and so directly related to the decision to continue to detain that it was clearly material in the Lumba sense.\\nWhether in reality it was a Lumba case is not for this Court to decide.\\nLORD KERR\\nI agree with Lord Hope that this appeal should be allowed for the reasons that he has given.\\nI also agree that the anonymity order should be set aside.\\nAs Lord Hope has said, it may be safely assumed that an asylum seeker will be alive to the risks that disclosure of his identity will entail and his stance on the question of anonymity, especially if he expresses no desire that it be maintained, will be of importance in striking the balance between avoiding unnecessary risks to the asylum seekers safety and the principle of open justice.\\nThe critical question in this appeal is whether compliance with the duty to review underpins the legality of the detention.\\nIt is accepted that there is a duty to review.\\nIt is further accepted that this duty had not been complied with.\\nDoes that make the detention unlawful? The respondent says that it does not, arguing that the situation encountered here is not comparable to that which demands compliance with a statutory obligation on which the condition of lawfulness of the detention depends.\\nIt is suggested that a failure to observe a public law duty should not render unlawful a hitherto lawful detention because there can be no sufficient nexus between such a failure and the lawfulness of the detention.\\nOne can acknowledge the initial appeal of the respondents argument.\\nIf a statute prescribes certain conditions that must be met in order that a person may be lawfully held in detention, where one of those conditions remains unfulfilled, the detention may be regarded as automatically unlawful.\\nBy contrast, the failure to fulfil a duty owed at public law will not necessarily render invalid a detention made on foot of a valid authorisation.\\nThe essential question must be whether there is an adequate connection between compliance with the duty and the lawfulness of the detention.\\nThe respondents argument proceeds on the premise that there can never be such a close link.\\nThe appellants case is that it depends on the circumstances some public law duties are so closely linked to the continued legality of the detention that a failure to comply with them transforms it from a condition of lawfulness to one which is unlawful.\\nThe case can be approached in a relatively simplistic way.\\nThe appellant has a legal entitlement to have the justification for his detention reviewed.\\nThis is not disputed.\\nLikewise it is not challenged that where there has been a violation of that right, the appellant must have a remedy.\\nIs that remedy to be confined to a declaration and/or an injunction? And if he is entitled to these forms of relief, why should he not be entitled to maintain an action for damages for false imprisonment? Given that what is at stake is the appellants liberty; that there is a presumption in favour of his release; that scrupulous adherence to the review standards is clearly contemplated in the language of the policy document; and that, plainly, these are considered to be vital safeguards of the detainees interests, I can discern no reason in principle to restrict the availability of all remedies that the law will conventionally afford for unlawful detention.\\nOn the contrary, it appears to me that access to the full panoply of such remedies is required in order that those fundamental interests are afforded proper protection.\\nAnother way of approaching the questions that arise on the appeal is to ask whether the initial authority to detain could be regarded as comprehensive of the issues which are germane to the continued lawfulness of detention.\\nQuite clearly, detention which is lawful initially can be transformed to a condition of illegality see R v Governor of Durham Prison Ex p Hardial Singh [1984] 1 WLR 704.\\nIn his argument to this court on behalf of the Secretary of State, Mr Tam QC has asserted that where the detention is initially lawful, it cannot become unlawful, absent an undermining of the initial authority to detain.\\nBut there was no undermining of the initial authority in that sense in Hardial Singh yet the initially lawful detention became unlawful.\\nThat transformation occurred by a means other than by operation of an express statutory pre condition or by the extinction of the initial authority to detain.\\nIn Hardial Singh it was held that there were implicit limitations on the statutory power to continue to detain.\\nIf, for instance, the original purpose of detention viz to deport became incapable of fulfilment, the detainee could no longer be lawfully held.\\nWhy should implicit limitations in the form of an effective review of the continuing justification for detention not be recognised in the present case? Where someone is detained beyond the immediate post detention period, there may be two aspects to the question whether his detention is lawful.\\nFirst there must be an initial valid authorisation; secondly, there must be compliance with such public law duties as touch directly on the question of whether he should continue to be detained.\\nThat proposition can perhaps be best exemplified in the context of a review of the justification of the reasons for continued detention by considering the purpose of that review.\\nOne starts with the unexceptionable proposition that it would be indisputably unlawful to hold someone in detention if there was no justification for it.\\nSince, self evidently, an original justification for detention may prove, in light of events and circumstances that occur subsequently, to no longer obtain, periodic review of the justification for continued detention is required.\\nThe purpose of the review is to determine whether there are still good grounds to continue to hold the person in detention.\\nIf the review discloses that there are no such grounds, continued detention is unquestionably illegal.\\nA person detained after it had been shown that there was no good reason for his continued detention would undoubtedly have the right to claim compensation for false imprisonment.\\nAs Lord Hope has said, support for the proposition that a departure from published policy as to detention will render it unlawful is to be found in R (Nadarajah) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] INLR 139.\\nLord Brown has sought to distinguish that case from the present appeal on the basis that in Nadarajah the grounds on which the power of executive detention could be exercised had been narrowed but that no such narrowing of powers occurred here.\\nBut if the published policy in Nadarajah narrowed the grounds on which someone could be lawfully detained, why should the same consequence not accrue in the present case? In Nadarajah the stated policy was to release those whose removal was not imminent.\\nHere it is to the effect that persons will only be detained if there is continuing justification for it, as verified by a prescribed system of review.\\nLord Brown suggests that in Nadarajah the detainee was entitled to release and in the present case that the appellant was entitled 'merely' to be reviewed for release.\\nI respectfully disagree that such a distinction can be drawn.\\nThe essence of the appellant's entitlement was that he would be released unless continued justification for his detention existed.\\nThe review was the means by which the existence of the justification was to be established.\\nIt is not comprehensive of the detainee's entitlement.\\nAs in Nadarajah the appellant in the present case is entitled to be released in accordance with the terms of the relevant policy, if justification for his continued detention no longer obtains.\\nWhat if no review takes place? If it is illegal to hold a person in detention where it has been established that there are no good grounds for doing so, can it be lawful to hold someone without examining whether such grounds continue to exist? In my view it cannot.\\nSince it has been recognised that, in cases such as the appellants, periodic review is necessary in order to vouch the continued justification for detention, where that review does not take place, the detention can no longer be considered justified.\\nThe justification for continued detention cannot be said to exist and, absent such justification, the detention is unlawful.\\nLikewise, in my opinion, where the review does take place but does not partake of the quality or character required to justify the continuance of detention, it becomes unlawful and gives rise to a right to claim false imprisonment.\\nI believe that Munby J was right in his characterisation of the system of review as being integral to the lawfulness of the detention (para 68 of his judgment).\\nIt was not only so stated in the policy document, this concept pervades the entire approach of government to this type of detention.\\nI accept, of course, that the Executive cannot make law and that the policy document should not be construed as a statute but it is not irrelevant that the Home Secretary made an unequivocal statement that failure to comply with the policy would be a breach of the law.\\nThis surely provides the foundation for a finding that the requirement of review is intimately connected to the continuing lawfulness of the detention and that it therefore constitutes an implicit limitation on the statutory power to detain.\\nThe majority in R (Lumba and Mighty) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 12; [2011] 2 WLR 671, has held that causation is not a necessary ingredient for liability.\\nIn that case the argument on behalf of the detained persons was put in this way: a public law error that bears directly on the decision to detain will mean that the authority for detention is ultra vires and unlawful, and will sound in false imprisonment.\\nThat argument was accepted by the majority of the court in Lumba.\\nThe public law error in the present case bore directly on the decision to detain in that it was made without the necessary review of the justification for detention.\\nAs the majority in Lumba also held, however, causation is relevant to the question of the recoverability of damages.\\nFor the reasons that I gave in my judgment in that case, I consider that if it can be shown that the claimant would not have been released if a proper review had been carried out, this must have an impact on the quantum of compensation and that nominal damages only will be recoverable.\\nLORD BROWN (with whom Lord Rodger agrees)\\nDoes a failure to comply with a published policy periodically to review the exercise of a statutory power of executive detention constitute not merely the breach of a public law duty but in addition the tort of false imprisonment? Does it, in other words, undermine the lawfulness of continuing detention? That essentially is the issue before the Court on this appeal.\\nLord Hopes judgment contains a very full account of the facts, the arguments and the authorities relevant to this appeal so that my own judgment can be correspondingly short.\\nThe Immigration Act 1971, as amended, (the 1971 Act) provides (by paragraphs 2(2) and (3) of Schedule 3) that, in a case like this, once notice of intention to deport has been given, the Secretary of State may detain the person pending the making of the deportation order (paragraph 2(2)) and, once the deportation order has been made, the detainee shall continue to be detained [pending his removal or departure] unless he is released on bail or the Secretary of State directs otherwise (paragraph 2(3)).\\nOne suspects that when these provisions were enacted nearly 40 years ago Parliament envisaged the deportation process taking place within a comparatively short timescale, perhaps months at most.\\nAs it is, however, the process regularly stretches to years and not infrequently the position arises where, for one reason or another, it proves impossible for a considerable time to deport anyone to a particular country because of conditions there.\\nIn the past this has been true at various times of Somalia, of Afghanistan, of Iraq, and of Kosovo.\\nSince 2005 it has also been true of Zimbabwe which is why this appellant, although given notice of an intention to deport him on 8 March 2006, and made subject to a deportation order on 24 August 2007, remains in this country to this day.\\nMore particularly, this is the background to his detention under Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act (following completion of a prison sentence) from 8 March 2006 to 13 June 2008 when, after 27 months of Schedule 3 detention, he was finally released on bail.\\nThat the Secretary of States power to detain people under paragraph 2 of Schedule 3 (the paragraph 2 power as for convenience I shall call it) is not unlimited is plain and undisputed.\\nThis was first established by Woolf J in R v Governor of Durham Prison Ex p Hardial Singh [1984] 1 WLR 704, approved by the Privy Council in Tan Te Lam v Superintendent of Tai A Chau Detention Centre [1997] AC 97 and subsequently distilled by Dyson LJ in R (I) v Secretary of State for the Home Department) [2003] INLR 196, para 46 into four propositions (which, again for convenience, I shall call the Hardial Singh principles), as follows: (i) The Secretary of State must intend to deport the person and can only use the power to detain for that purpose. (ii) The deportee may only be detained for a period that is reasonable in all the circumstances. (iii) If, before the expiry of the reasonable period, it becomes apparent that the Secretary of State will not be able to effect deportation within that reasonable period, he should not seek to exercise the power of detention. (iv) The Secretary of State should act with reasonable diligence and expedition to effect removal.\\nAlthough suggested by the appellant to be broadly similar to the protections implied by the ECtHR into article 5(1)(f) of the Convention to ensure proportionality and guard against arbitrariness, to my mind the Hardial Singh principles, certainly as applied in a succession of later cases, are in fact more favourable to detainees than Strasbourg requires.\\nIn particular Strasbourg has consistently stated that there is no requirement that the detention be reasonably considered necessary, for example to prevent the person concerned from committing an offence or fleeing (para 72 of the Grand Chambers judgment in Saadi v UK (2008) 47 EHRR 427, following Chahal v UK (1996) 23 EHRR 413, para 112).\\nDomestic case law, by contrast, holds that with regard to the second Hardial Singh principle the deportee may only be detained for a period that is reasonable in all circumstances [t]he likelihood or otherwise of the detainee absconding and/or re offending [is] an obviously relevant circumstance (my judgment in I at para 29, echoed by Dyson LJ at paras 48 and 49).\\nI may note at this point that, notwithstanding that the full width of the Hardial Singh principles was clearly recognised by Munby J in the present case (paras 79 120), his conclusion was that none of them had been breached at any time, a conclusion unchallenged in the Court of Appeal.\\nIt follows that not merely was the appellant in a formal sense a person liable to be detained under the third Schedule (in the same way that the unsuccessful appellant in R (Khadir) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2006] 1 AC 207 was held liable to detention and thus eligible for temporary admission under the second Schedule even though it might well have been unreasonable and in breach of the Hardial Singh principles actually to have detained him); here the appellant was liable to be detained in the fuller sense that throughout the period of his detention it would have been a lawful and reasonable exercise of the paragraph 2 power actually to detain him.\\nOn what basis, then, is it said that the appellants detention was unlawful so as to give rise to a claim for damages for false imprisonment? The argument revolves around the Secretary of States published policy: chapter 38 of the Departments Operations Enforcement Manual (the OEM) under the heading Detention and Temporary Release.\\nThe policy (at 38.3) includes a presumption in favour of temporary admission or temporary release, provides that [t]here must be strong grounds for believing that a person will not comply with conditions of temporary admission or temporary release for detention to be justified and that [a]ll reasonable alternatives to detention must be considered before detention is authorised, and dictates that [o]nce detention has been authorised, it must be kept under close review to ensure that it continues to be justified.\\nParagraph 38.8 then specifies how both the initial detention and any continued detention thereafter are to be authorised and kept under review, expressly providing both for the frequency and for the level of seniority of the reviews required.\\nIn the event, as Munby J recorded (para 48), although entitled (by the date of the first instance hearing) to no fewer than 22 monthly reviews of the lawfulness of his detention, the appellant had had the benefit of only ten reviews, of which only six were conducted by officials of the requisite seniority, and of those six, two had had to be disavowed as fatally flawed.\\nParagraph 38.1 of the policy, headed General, states: To be lawful, detention must not only be based on one of the statutory powers and accord with the limitations implied by domestic and Strasbourg case law but must also accord with this stated policy.\\nIn a sense the question now before us is quite simply: is that statement accurate? Munby J in effect held that it was, not only as to the substantive requirements to justify continuing detention but as to the review requirements also.\\nAt para 68 of his judgment, having referred to rule 9(1) of the Detention Centre Rules (which, like Lord Hope, I think to be of only peripheral relevance) he continued: [I]ntegral to the policy laid down by the Secretary of State in paragraph 38.8 of the Operations Enforcement Manual, is the principle that someone is not to be detained beyond a certain period without there being a review undertaken at regular intervals and moreover, as required by the Secretary of States policy, a review undertaken at increasingly high levels of seniority within the Home Office as the period of detention grows longer.\\nThose reviews are fundamental to the propriety of the continuing detention, they are required in order to ensure that the continuing detention can still be justified in the light of current, and perhaps changed, circumstances, and they are, in my judgment, a necessary prerequisite to the continuing legality of the detention.\\nThat paragraph identifies the critical question: is the holding of the reviews required by the OEM a necessary prerequisite to the continuing legality of the detention? In addressing this question it is convenient first to distinguish the present case from certain other authorities strongly relied upon by the respective parties.\\nThe appellant (supported by the Intervener) seeks to pray in aid the Court of Appeals decision in Roberts v Chief Constable of the Cheshire Constabulary [1999] 1 WLR 662.\\nThe case turned on the proper construction of Part IV of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (the Part containing each of the sections to which I now refer).\\nThe detainee, following arrest, was initially kept in police detention pursuant to section 37.\\nSection 40(1) provided that: Reviews of the detention of each person in police detention in connection with the investigation of an offence shall be carried out periodically in accordance with the following provisions of this section.\\nSection 40(3)(a) provided that the first review shall be not later than six hours after the detention was first authorised.\\nCentral to the decision that, no such review within six hours having taken place, the detainees continued detention (until the point two hours, twenty minutes later when his detention was reviewed) had been unlawful (notwithstanding that had he been reviewed at the six hour point he clearly would still have been detained), was section 34(1) which provided that: A person arrested for an offence shall not be kept in police detention except in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Act.\\nMunby J appears to have thought Roberts strongly supportive of the appellants case.\\nLaws LJ, giving the leading judgment in the Court of Appeal, thought otherwise.\\nAs he pointed out ([2009] 1 WLR 1527, para 25): [T]he requirement of periodic review, on the proper construction of the statute, had to be satisfied as a condition precedent to the legality of the suspects detention.\\nIt was made so by the express terms of section 34(1).\\nBut there is no analogue to section 34(1) of PACE to be found in paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 3 to the Immigration Act 1971.\\nThere is no reference in the sub paragraph, express or implied, to the Rules or the manual or to any Rules that might be made under powers in the Immigration Act or to any manual, or instructions, that might be issued by the Secretary of State.\\nI cannot see how compliance with the letter of the Rules or manual could be said to be a sine qua non of a lawful exercise of the power to detain unless paragraph 2(2) (or other main legislation) made it so.\\nBut it does not.\\nI agree with Laws LJ that Roberts provides little if any assistance to the appellant here.\\nThe respondent for his part seeks to rely on R (Walker) v Secretary of State for Justice (Parole Board intervening) [2010] 1 AC 553 in support of his argument that a failure in the review process does not undermine the legality of (the unreviewed) continuing detention.\\nWalker was concerned with a number of appeals by IPP prisoners justifiably complaining of the Secretary of States systemic failures to provide the necessary resources and systems to enable such prisoners to demonstrate to the Parole Board that they could safely be released.\\nThe Divisional Court held in one of the cases, R (Wells) Parole Board [2008] 1 All ER 138, para 47: To the extent that the prisoner remains incarcerated after tariff expiry without any current and effective assessment of the danger he does or does not pose, his detention cannot in reason be justified.\\nIt is therefore unlawful.\\nThe Court of Appeal and the House of Lords disagreed.\\nAs I put it (at paras 36 37): It is one thing to say as, indeed, is now undisputed that the Secretary of State was in breach (even systemic breach) of his public law duty to provide such courses as would enable IPP prisoners to demonstrate their safety for release and, to some extent at least, courses enabling them to reduce the risk they pose, duties inherent in the legislation (the legislations underlying premise [as it was described in the court below]); quite another to say that such breach of duty results in detention being unlawful.\\nI respectfully agree with the Court of Appeal that it does not.\\nThe remedy for such breach of public law duty indeed the only remedy, inadequate though in certain respects it may be is declaratory relief condemning the Secretary of States failures and indicating that he is obliged to do more.\\nBy the same token, submits Mr Tam QC, the undisputed (and here too systemic) breaches of the Secretary of States public law duty to review, consistently with his published policy, the justifiability of the appellants (and doubtless very many other detainees) continuing detention, although (as in Walker) deeply to be regretted and strongly to be condemned, does not result in the unreviewed detention being unlawful.\\nTo my mind, however, Walker is no more helpful to the respondents case than Roberts is to the appellants.\\nAgain, as in Walker, the primary legislation made the position clear: IPP prisoners were expressly made subject to the statutory requirement (under section 28 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997) that they were not to be released until the Parole Board was satisfied that their continuing confinement was no longer necessary for the protection of the public.\\nIn the same way that Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act contains no analogue to section 34(1) of PACE, so too it contains no analogue to section 28 of the 1997 Act.\\nLaws LJ below identified (at para 21) the essential question here to be: What is the reach [of the paragraph 2 power] and characterised it as a question of statutory construction.\\nAt paragraph 35 he summarised his conclusions upon the question as follows: (i) Compliance with the Rules and manual as such is not a condition precedent to a lawful detention pursuant to paragraph 2(2).\\nStatute does not make it so (contrast section 34(1) of PACE, and the Roberts case [1999] 1 WLR 662).\\nNor does the common law, or the law of the Convention. (ii) Avoidance of the vice of arbitrary detention by use of the power conferred by paragraph 2(2) requires that in every case the Hardial Singh principles should be complied with. (iii) It is elementary that the power exercised, being an act of the executive, is subject to the control of the courts, principally by way of judicial review.\\nSo much is also required by Convention article 5(4).\\nThe focus of judicial supervision in the particular context is upon the vindication of the Hardial Singh principles. (iv) In the event of a legal challenge to any particular case the Secretary of State must be in a position to demonstrate by evidence that those principles have been and are being fulfilled.\\nHowever the law does not prescribe the form of such evidence.\\nCompliance with the Rules and the manual would be an effective and practical means of doing so.\\nIt is anyway the Secretary of States duty so to comply.\\nIt is firmly to be expected that hereafter that will be conscientiously done.\\nMr Raza Husains attack upon that paragraph centres upon the proposition that, following the initial exercise of the paragraph 2 power, the Secretary of State has a continuing discretion whether to maintain the detention and is under a duty to exercise that discretion regularly in accordance with the published policy.\\nSo much Mr Tam accepts and, indeed, he further accepts that every failure to review a detention by the specified time or by the specified level of decision maker constitutes a breach of the Secretary of States public law duty.\\nOf course, as Mr Husain recognises, not all breaches of public law duties arising in the context of detention would render its continuation unlawful see, for example, Cullen v Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary [2003] 1 WLR 1763.\\nThe key question, he submits, is whether the breach is sufficiently closely linked to the detention decision.\\nHere, he contends, it plainly was.\\nThe authority (Roberts aside) upon which Mr Husain principally relies is the decision of the Court of Appeal in R (Nadarajah) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] INLR 139 (a report dealing also with Amirthanathans appeal I shall call them respectively N and A).\\nThat case too concerned the Secretary of States detention policy under chapter 38 of the OEM but not, as here, the review provisions rather the statement that one of the reasons for detaining an asylum seeker is that his removal from the UK is imminent.\\nWhat was not part of the published policy and so was not publicly known was the Departments further policy, when considering the imminence of removal, to disregard information from those acting for asylum seekers that proceedings were about to be instituted, however credible that information might be.\\nNs solicitors had given notice of his intention to seek judicial review of the Secretary of States decision to certify his case as manifestly unfounded.\\nAs solicitors similarly had notified his intention to exercise his right of appeal against the Secretary of States rejection of his Human Rights Act claim to remain.\\nThe detentions of both on the ground that their removal was imminent were held unlawful.\\nIt was, said the Court of Appeal (at para 68), at odds with [the Secretary of States] policy, as made public.\\nAdditionally, in As case, it was clear that he had in fact been kept detained so as to facilitate the obtaining of the documentation needed for his removal.\\nThis too was at odds with the Secretary of States policy, as made public (para 72).\\nI confess that for a time I was persuaded by the appellants argument and thought it supported by the authority of Nadarajah.\\nIn the end, however, I have reached the contrary view.\\nNadarajah now seems to me clearly distinguishable.\\nNot because, as the Court of Appeal noted in that case at para 69, had Ns solicitor been aware of the Secretary of States unpublished policy she would have instituted judicial review proceedings earlier, so that the departure from the published policy was in fact causative of Ns continued detention.\\nRather Nadarajah is distinguishable because it is one thing, as there, to adopt a published policy which in substance narrows the grounds on which an executive power of detention is exercisable (the stated policy there being to release those whose removal was not imminent); quite another, as here, to have a policy and programme for review which dictates only the procedure whereby detention will regularly be reviewed.\\nIn the former case, under the published policy the detainee was entitled to release; in the latter case, he was not he was entitled merely to be reviewed for release.\\nNaturally, upon the intended reviews, the detainee would be released if, as a matter of substance, his continuing detention were found no longer justifiable according to the published policy.\\nThe difference, however, seems to me crucial.\\nIn the one case a breach of policy renders continuing detention unlawful.\\nIn the other it does not.\\nLady Hale, at para 72 of her judgment, suggests an analogy between the present case and Christie v Leachinsky [1947] AC 573 which established the common law requirement that an arrested person be told, at the time, the reason for his arrest.\\nFor my part I find the suggestion unpersuasive.\\nAs Lady Hale herself observes, the requirement was imposed for the very good reason that the arrested person had to know whether or not he was entitled to resist arrest.\\nLord Simonds put it thus (p591): it is the corollary of the right of every citizen to be thus free from arrest [unless, that is, someone has the right to arrest him] that he should be entitled to resist arrest unless that arrest is lawful.\\nHow can these rights be reconciled with the proposition that he may be arrested without knowing why he is arrested? and a little later (p.592): . the subject is entitled to know why he is deprived of his freedom, if only in order that he may, without a moments delay, take such steps as will enable him to regain it.\\nNo such consideration arises or could arise in the present content.\\nTheir Lordships in Christie v Leachinsky would, I think, be astonished at the suggestion that any failure to give effect to a self imposed requirement for periodic review of the continuing detention of those awaiting deportation similarly renders that detention unlawful.\\nI fear that they would be scarcely less surprised by the further suggestion (at para 77 of Lady Hales judgment) that, assuming such detention to be unlawful, it is to be compensated by no more than a nominal sum in damages.\\nIndeed it seems to me that that very suggestion illustrates the ineptness of the proposed analogy between the two cases in the first place.\\nThe majoritys proposed solution to this case would quite simply devalue the whole concept of false imprisonment.\\nNothing that I have said should be taken to depreciate the desirability and importance of reviews under chapter 38 nor to excuse the Departments lamentable failures to conduct them, certainly in the appellants case and very probably in a host of others.\\nAs the courts below rightly observed, these matters go to the liberty of the subject and the picture which emerges is deeply disturbing, indeed profoundly shocking (Munby J, para 137).\\nOne obvious consequence of such serial failures is that it creates a substantially greater risk of detainees bringing successful proceedings for breach of the Hardial Singh principles (or, indeed, assuming they are still more favourable to detainees, the Secretary of States published policy statements going to the substantive criteria for release, as in Nadarajah itself) principles and statements to which the reviews are intended and likely to give effect.\\nAnd, of course, as the Hardial Singh line of authority (and, indeed, Nadarajah) clearly establishes, a successful claim on these grounds carries with it a right to damages for false imprisonment, a right to damages, moreover, which, unlike that arising upon a failure to review such as envisaged by the majority (and, indeed, such as arose in Roberts see p669H), would naturally be untroubled by any question of causation.\\nI recognise, of course, that, on this approach, it is only in cases where the detainee can show that he should have been released that the respondent will be required to pay, financially, for failures in the review process.\\nWhere, as here, all that can be shown is a series of public law breaches failures to comply with his own published policy as to reviews the only remedy, as in Walker, is by way of declaratory relief.\\nUnsatisfactory though in one way this is, to treat a failure in the review process (perhaps merely a review held a day late or by someone of insufficient seniority and perhaps in respect of an obviously dangerous detainee) as of itself giving rise (as in Roberts) to a claim for false imprisonment would to my mind be unsatisfactory too.\\nThere may well be altogether too many people (above all children and other likewise vulnerable people) locked up awaiting deportation.\\nPlainly a wise Secretary of State would instigate and operate a practicable and robust system for minimising the use made of the paragraph 2 power.\\nAs it is, like any other public body failing to comply with their published policy, he commits a breach of his public law duty, always a regrettable state of affairs.\\nThat said, however, a detainee, once properly detained, in my opinion remains lawfully imprisoned unless and until released on bail or by the Secretary of States direction or he establishes an entitlement to release pursuant to the Hardial Singh principles or other substantive policy statements governing how the Secretary of State will exercise his paragraph 2 power.\\nThis appellant could establish no such entitlement.\\nIn my judgment he remained lawfully imprisoned until he was bailed.\\nIt will be noted that I have not hitherto referred to article 5(1)(f) of the Convention save only to observe (at para 94) that domestic law is in fact more favourable to detainees awaiting deportation than Strasbourg requires.\\nSince it now appears that this is to be a minority judgment, I need say no more than that there is nothing in the existing Strasbourg jurisprudence which would warrant a conclusion that a failure to give effect to the Secretary of States self imposed requirement for detention reviews would result in unlawful detention under the Convention irrespective of whether it constitutes false imprisonment under the common law. (I do not think I am in disagreement with the majority as to this see, for example, para 76 of Lady Hales judgment.) Nor, of course, is there any question here of a breach of article 5(4) of the Convention: the requirements of that provision are amply satisfied by the detainees right to seek bail or, indeed, judicial review.\\nI would dismiss this appeal.\\nThe above (paras 90 113) is the judgment I wrote before an enlarged court of nine of us in November 2010 heard, and subsequently, on 23 March 2011, gave judgment in, R (Lumba and Mighty) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 12; [2011] 2 WLR 671 (Lumba).\\nGiven that a majority of the court (6:3) held that the particular public law breaches committed by the Secretary of State there resulted in the appellants being falsely imprisoned albeit a differently constituted majority (also 6:3) held that they can recover no more than nominal damages should I (must I) now change my judgment and agree with the majority that Mr Kambadzi too was falsely imprisoned?\\nI have concluded not: it by no means follows from the majority view on liability in Lumba that there is liability here too and to my mind it would be still more undesirable to find liability established here than the minority of us thought it to be in Lumba itself.\\nThat the two cases are different is plain enough.\\nAs Lord Dyson observed in para 61 of his lead judgment: A somewhat similar problem arose in R (SK Zimbabwe) v Secretary of State for the Home Department In that case the unlawfulness lay in the failure of the Secretary of State to comply with her policy which prescribed the procedural requirements for reviews of FNPs who are already in detention.\\nThe present case concerns the substantive requirements for the initial detention of FNPs as well as their continued detention.\\nLady Hale too (para 198) recognised that on the issue of liability Lumba is a stronger case than is still before the court in SK (Zimbabwe) because the illegality alleged (and now admitted) went to the criteria for detention rather than to the procedure for authorising it.\\nAlthough, obviously, the court in Lumba was not required to consider the consequences in terms of liability of a public law failure to comply with the Secretary of States self imposed requirements for the review of continuing detention, there appear to me a number of passages in the judgments of those holding liability to be established there, strongly suggesting that they might well have taken a very different view in the present case.\\nThis is perhaps plainest at paras 193 and 194 of Lord Walkers judgment: It is a big step to extend the [Anisminic] principle to a claim for damages for false imprisonment, where a defendant may have his professional reputation at stake and may not enjoy the procedural protections which attend judicial review (strict time limits, and the discretionary nature of the remedy granted).\\nI would prefer a more demanding test, that in a case where an extant statutory power to detain has been wrongly used there would be a private law claim only if the misuse amounted to an abuse of power (including but not limited to cases of misfeasance or other conscious misuse of power). 194 However, it is in my opinion unnecessary to decide the point in these appeals because the conduct of officials, including some senior officials, of the Home Office between April 2006 and September 2008 amounted to a serious abuse of power.\\nLord Dyson SCJ has . described in restrained language how senior officials were well aware of the risk (indeed the likelihood) of challenge and decided to run the risk, (including the proposal to let immigration judges take any hit), and how further damaging facts were disclosed by stages, some before Davis J, some before the Court of Appeal and some only in this court.\\nWherever the line is to be drawn (if, as I think, a line does need to be drawn between public law errors in detention policies which do or do not give rise to an action for false imprisonment) these appeals must in my view fall on the wrong side of the line from the Secretary of States point of view.\\nGiven that a line is to be drawn between public law errors amounting to the sort of serious misconduct which Lord Walker was clearly intending to denote by his use of the expression abuse of power and other public law errors which do not give rise to actions for false imprisonment, it is very far from obvious that Lord Walker would regard the failures in the review process here as an abuse of power.\\nLord Collins too, having referred (at para 220) to the Home Offices deliberate decision . to continue an unlawful policy and to the cynical nature of its approach generally in these cases, expressed himself (at para 221) satisfied that the serious breach of public law in this case has the result that the detention of the appellants was unlawful (emphasis added).\\nEven Lord Dyson (para 68) expressly accepted that: It is not every breach of public law that is sufficient to give rise to a cause of action in false imprisonment.\\nIn the present context, the breach of public law must bear on and be relevant to the decision to detain.\\nThus, for example, the decision to detain made by an official of a different grade from that specified in a detention policy would not found a claim in false imprisonment.\\nIt seems clear, therefore, that Lord Dyson would have rejected Mr Kambadzis case at least in respect of the four monthly reviews carried out by officials of the wrong grade although, I acknowledge, it is unclear what conclusion he would have reached with regard to the twelve omitted reviews.\\nOf course, the three of us who dissented on liability in Lumba would by definition conclude that Mr Kambadzi must fail on liability in the present case.\\nAs for why, liability in Lumba notwithstanding, it would be wrong to find false imprisonment established here too, let me illustrate what seems to me the absurdity of such conclusion by the example I gave (at para 357) in Lumba: it would result in a detainee whose detention is reviewed every second month instead of monthly as the published policy dictates, alternat[ing] yo yo like between lawful detention and false imprisonment.\\nTo hold that false imprisonment is the consequence of a failure to comply with the substantive requirements for the initial detention of FNPs as well as their continued detention (Lord Dyson at para 61, quoted above) is one thing; to hold that the same consequence follows a failure to comply with the procedural requirements for reviews of FNPs who are already in detention (ibid) is quite another and to my mind a step altogether too far.\\nI therefore remain of the view, the authority of Lumba notwithstanding, that this appeal should be dismissed.\\nOn the issue of anonymity I agree with Lord Hope.\\nAs was recently established by the Courts comprehensive and authoritative judgment given by Lord Rodger in In re Guardian News and Media Ltd [2010] 2 AC 697, the general rule is that parties to proceedings are named and that an anonymity order has to be justified.\\nIn my opinion there is no justification for such an order here and, indeed, Mr Husain on behalf of the appellant suggests none and seeks no such order.\\nThere may, of course, be good reason in certain asylum cases for maintaining the asylum seekers anonymity notwithstanding that his claim fails: the very fact of his having made a claim, albeit unsuccessful, could on occasion tip the balance and give rise to a genuine fear of persecution or article 3 ill treatment where previously none existed.\\nDoubtless in any such case counsel, certainly counsel as expert and experienced as Mr Husain, would duly seek the necessary anonymity order.\\nGiven, however, that this appellants asylum claim was clearly bogus, it is unsurprising that no such application was made here and it is to my mind inconceivable that the appellants known involvement in these proceedings could give rise to any bona fide further asylum claim.\\n\")]\n","\n","\n","UK test summary: 100\n","[('uksc-2009-0073.txt', 'The appellants were convicted of serious criminal offences after trials in which the victims of

Lal, for the respondent.\\nSeptember 27.\\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by MUDHOLKAR, J.\\nThese three appeals arise out of three separate trials before the Additional Sessions judge, Bulandshahr, but were argued together as they arise identical questions.\\nIn all these trials, the appellant, who was a postman attached to the Bulandshahr post office was tried for offences under section 52 of the Indian Post Office Act, 1898 (VI of 1898) and in two of \\' them, also for offences under sections 467 and 471 of the Indian Penal Code.\\nBriefly stated the allegations against the appellant were that he either stole or secreted five registered letters and that he fabricated three receipts showing that the registered letters were received by the addressees.\\nThe learned Additional Sessions judge acquitted the appellant of all these offences.\\nThe State then preferred an appeal against his acquittal in these three cases to the High Court of Allahabad but restricted the appeal to the acquittal of the appellant in respect of offences under 410 section 52 of the Indian Post Office Act, 1898 (hereafter referred to as the Act).\\nThe High Court held that the appellant had secreted the five registered letters in question and on this finding set aside his acquittal and convicted him in each of the three appeals for offences under section 52 of the Act and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of one year in each case.\\nThe appellant has come up to this Court by special leave.\\nBriefly stated the prosecution case is that when the house in which the appellant lives along with his father Diwan Singh, a retired Police Head Constable, was searched by the C.I.D. Inspector, S.N. Singh, along with Masood Murtaza, Sub Inspector of Police, Bulandshahr on May 12, 1956, in connection with a case against Messrs Greenwood Publicity, they accidentally discovered a large number of letters and postcards and also the five registered letters in question.\\nAt the time of the search the appellant who happens to be a trade union official, was not in Bulandshahr but was away on leave at Delhi in connection with a postal conference.\\nThese articles were found in an almirah, the key of which was produced by the appellant \\'s father.\\nThe articles were not listed at the spot but were taken to the Kotwali in a sealed packet and later on listed there.\\nA number of other articles were also seized at that time but we are not concerned with them as they have no connection with the charges against the appellant.\\nBriefly, the appellant \\'s defence in all these cases is that there are two factions in the Bulandshahr post office and that these articles were planted by the opposite party.\\nAccording to him, the planting must have occurred in the Kotwali when the Sub Inspector purported to make a list of the articles seized from the house in which the appellant lives.\\nFurther, according to him, neither the house nor the almirah from which the articles are said to have been 411 seized was in his exclusive possession.\\nHe stated and that fact is not denied that the house which consists of two rooms only has been rented in his father \\'s name, that both of them live in those two rooms and that the almirah was in his father \\'s possession inasmuch as the key was produced by him.\\nOn behalf of the appellant Mr. B. C. Misra has raised the following six points: (1) That on the findings arrived at by the High Court no offence under section 52 of the Post Office Act has been made out.\\n(2) That it has not been established that the five registered letters were in the exclusive possession of the appellant.\\n(3) That the search was illegal inasmuch as it was in contravention of the provisions of sections 103 and 165 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\\n(4) That in examining the appellant the Ad ditional Session Judge did not comply with the requirements of section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\\n(5) That the High Court has not found that there were compelling reasons for setting aside the appellant \\'s acquittal .\\n(6) The sentences in the three cases having been ordered to run consecutively the total sentence is excessive.\\nWe will deal with the last four points first.\\nSo far as the alleged illegality of the search is concerned it is sufficient to say that even assuming that the search was illegal the seizure of the articles is not vitiated.\\nIt may be that where the provisions of \\' sections 103 and 165, Code of Criminal Procedure, are 412 contravened the search could be resisted by the person whose premises are sought to be searched.\\nIt may also be that because of the illegality of the search the Court may be inclined to examine carefully the evidence regarding the seizure.\\nBut beyond these two consequences no further consequence ensues.\\nThe High Court has chosen to accept the evidence of the prosecution with regard to the fact of seizure and that being a question to be decided only by the Court of fact, this Court would not re examine the evidence for satisfying itself as to the correctness or otherwise of the conclusions reached by the High Court.\\nIn so far as the contravention of provisions of section 342, Code of Criminal Procedure, are concerned it is sufficient to point out that no grievance was made either before the Court of the Additional Sessions judge or before the High Court that there was such a contravention and the appellant was prejudiced and we cannot allow the point to be raised for the first time here, the reason being that whether there was prejudice is a question of fact and cannot be permitted to be agitated for the first time in an appeal under article 136 of the Constitution.\\nAs regards the fifth point, it is sufficient to say that this Court has held that an appeal from acquittal need not be treated differently from an appeal from conviction and if the High Court finds that the acquittal is not justified by the evidence on record it can set aside the acquittal without coming to the conclusion that there were compelling reasons for doing so.\\nIn so far as the sentence is concerned, bearing in mind the fact that the maximum sentence awarded under section 52 of the Act is seven years it would not be right to say that in ordering the sentences in the three cases to run consecutively the appellant is being very severely punished.\\nIn so far as section 52 of the Act is concerned the argument is that the prosecution having merely shown that the registered letters were recovered from an almirah in the house in which the appellant lives the 413 utmost that could be said is that he was in possession of letters, that is, assuming that he was in the exclusive possession of the house and the almirah.\\nThe mere fact of possession, according to learned counsel, does not suffice to show that the letters were secreted by the appellant.\\nIt is contended that for an officer of the post office to be found guilty for any of the acts specified in section 52 it has further to be shown that he was entrusted with the postal article with respect to which he is alleged to have committed any of those acts.\\nSection 52 of the Act runs thus : \"Penalty for theft, dishonest, misappropriation, secretion, destruction, or throwing away of postal articles.\\nWhoever, being an officer of the Post Office, commits theft in respect of, or dishonestly misappropriates, or, for any purpose whatsoever, secretes, destroys or throws away, any postal article in course of transmission by post or anything contained therein, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be punishable with fine.\\n\" The first act referred to in this section is theft.\\nSurely it cannot be contended that any (entrustment \\' is necessary with regard to that act.\\nIndeed, if entrustment were proved and the article entrusted is not found to have been disposed of in the manner permissible under the Act, the offence committed would be not theft but criminal breach of trust.\\naccording to Mr. Misra, the appellant cannot be said to have secreted the letter just because it was found in the almirah which is said to have been in his exclusive possession.\\nTo secrete means, according to the dictionary \"to hide\".\\nIn connection with a postal article addressed to some person the fact that it is retained in his possession by an officer of the post office in an almirah and that too for an inordinately long period would be tantamount to hiding that 414 article.\\nOf course, what act amounts to \"secreting\" would necessarily depend upon the facts of each case and in our opinion in a case like the present, what \\'has been established by the prosecution would sustain an inference of secreting.\\nFurther, a perusal of section 55 makes it clear that where the entrustment of an article is made an ingredient of an offence, the legislature has used appropriate words to make the matter clear.\\nIf, therefore, it was the intention of \\' the legislature that for an officer of the post office to be punished for secreting, destroying or throwing away a postal article in the oucrse of transmission by post, entrustment of that article to him was essential it would have used language similar to that used by it in section 55.\\nIt seems to us that bearing in mind the \\' fact that an officer of the post office having in the course of his duties access to postal articles kept or lying in the post office, the legislature has deliberately enlarged the scope of section 52 so as to encompass secretion, destruction or throwing away of postal articles by an officer of the post office even though they may not have been entrusted to him or even though the are riot articles with which he is required or is competent to deal in the course of his duties.\\nThe object of the provision is to prevent postal articles \\'in course of transmission by post \\' from being tampered with, and so the secreting, destruction \\' etc., of postal articles to which the provision is directed is to such secreting, destruction etc., as would frustrate or tend to frustrate their delivery to the addressees.\\nThen Mr. Misra contended that it would not be correct to say that the five registered letters recovered from the almirah were in the course of transmission by post because that recovery was made 7 or 8 months after those letters had been despatched and that no complaint had ever been made regarding their nondelivery by the senders or the addressees of those letters.\\nHe further referred to the fact that at least in respect of three of the registered letters 415 acknowledgments purporting to be from the addressee were obtained and were with the post office.\\nHe admitted that the prosecution allegation was that those documents were fabricated but that case having failed before the Court of Sessions and the Government not having appealed against that part of the decision of that court it must be held that at least three of those letters were duly received by the addressees.\\nThe expression \"in course of transmission by post\" has been defined in section 3 (a) of the Act as follows : .lm15 \" a postal article shall be deemed to be in course of transmission by post from the time of its being delivered to a Post Office to the time of its being delivered to the addressee or of its being returned to the sender or otherwise disposed of under Chapter VII.\\n\" The mere fact that there is even a delay of several months in delivering a postal article to the addressee would not mean that the article had ceased to be in course of transmission.\\nIt is common experience that delivery of postal articles is now and again delayed for a considerable length of time may be through accident or through the negligence of the postal employees.\\nIt is probably for this reason that the definition clearly lays down that until an article despatched by post is delivered or can be said to be delivered that it will be deemed to be in course of transmission.\\nWe cannot, therefore, accept the first part of this contention of Mr. Misra.\\nAs regards the other point, that is, based on the fact that there were acknowledgments in respect of three letters in the post office we may point out that the existence of these acknowledgments would no more than raise a presumption that those articles were delivered to the addressees.\\nThe addressees have been examined in this case and they have deposed that the letters in question were not received by them.\\nTheir 416 evidence has been believed by the High Court and therefore, there is an end to the matter.\\nIn the circumstances, therefore, we do not accept Mr. Misra \\'s contention that the act of an officer of the post office in being in possession of a postal article for an inordinate length of time has no significance and cannot justify the conclusion that he had secreted the article.\\nThe next and in our opinion the most important question to be considered is whether the prosecution has established that the five registered letters in question were recovered from the possession of the appellant.\\nAs already stated, all that the prosecution has been able to prove is this case is that these letters were found in an almirah of the house in which the appellant lives jointly with his father and of which the key was furnished by the father.\\nDealing with this question the High Court has observed as follows : \"In the first place, the respondent alone had the opportunity and the means to secure such a large number of postal articles.\\n(2) that at least nine of those postal articles were addressed to the respondent himself (vide exhibit Ka 9, serial No. 66), (3) that Dewan Singh, who, we are informed is a very old man, would not foist the said incriminating articles on his son and thus ruin his career for ever, and (4) that the respondent alone can be said to have had some motive for secreting and concealing the registered letters and other postal articles in question.\\n\" Before the High Court could take into consideration the circumstance that as between himself and his father the appellant had a better opportunity to 417 get at postal articles it had to find affirmatively that the almirah was in the exclusive possession of the appellant.\\nWe have not been able to discover anything in the judgment which directly bears on this question.\\nAs the key was produced by the appellant \\'s father and there is no evidence that it was ever with the appellant it would not be legitimate to infer that the almirah was even in the appellant \\'s joint, much less in his exclusive, possession.\\nTile circumstance that the almirah contained, apart from the registered letters in question, certain other articles belonging to the appellant cannot sustain an inference that the almirah was in the appellant \\'s possession exclusively or even jointly with his father.\\nWe may recall that the almirah contained a large number of articles belonging to the father and since he had the key with him it must be he who must be deemed to be in possession of the almirah and consequently of its contents including the registered letters in question.\\nApart from that, out of the four reasons given by it, the last, as pointed out by the High Court itself, is a speculative reason and must, therefore, be left out of consideration.\\nThe second \\'reason \\' is no reason at all because a very large number of articles found in the almirah admittedly belong to the father.\\nThe third reason that the rather would not foist articles to incriminate the son and thus ruin his career assumes that had the father kept the articles he could have done so only if he wanted to incri minate the son.\\nWe cannot understand why the father, if he happened to get possession of the articles from some source may not have kept them in the almirah in the same way in which he had kept the other articles belonging to him.\\nThat leaves, therefore, only the first reason.\\nWe doubt if on the basis of this reason alone the High Court could have held that though the locked almirah was not in the exclusive possession of the appellant, these articles were in his exclusive possession.\\nIf the point to be 418 established was whether the appellant had availed himself of the opportunity to procure the articles it could have been established by showing that he was in their exclusive possession.\\nBut to say that he must be deemed to be in exclusive possession of these articles and not merely in their joint possession along with his father because he had the opportunity to get at the articles and then infer that he must have utilized the opportunity and was therefore in their exclusive possession would be arguing in a circle.\\nMoreover since entrustment of the articles has not been established, the taking away of the articles by the appellant from the post office (if that is how he came by the articles) would be theft but it has not been found that he committed any theft.\\nIndeed, had it been so found he could have been convicted under section 52 without the Court having to consider whether he had secreted the articles.\\nWe may mention that Mr. Mathur who appears for the State does not even suggest that the articles were stolen by the appellant.\\nTherefore, the contention that he had an opportunity to get at the articles loses all significance and can possibly have no bearing on the question as to the nature of possession attributable to the appellant.\\nIn the circumstances we must hold that the prosecution has failed to prove that these letters were in the exclusive possession of the appellant.\\nNo presumption can, therefore, be drawn against him that he had secreted them from the mere fact that they were found in the almirah which, at best, may be regarded as being in the joint possession of himself and his father.\\nBut, as already stated, even an, inference of joint possession would not be legitimate.\\nFor these reasons we allow the three appeals and set aside the conviction and sentences passed against the appellant.\\nAppeal allowed.\\n')]\n","\n","\n","IN test summary: 100\n","[('1406.txt', 'S,

were married for 38 years.\\nBoth Nigerian by birth, they had met in England in the 1960s and acquired UK citizenship in 1972.\\nAll five of their children were born (and all but one educated) in England, and in 1975 Mr Agbaje bought a property in England called Lytton Road in which their children stayed with a nanny.\\nBut for the majority of their married life Mr and Mrs Agbaje lived in Nigeria.\\nThey separated in 1999, at which point Mrs Agbaje came to live in Lytton Road.\\nShe has lived here ever since.\\nIn 2003 Mr Agbaje issued divorce proceedings in the Nigerian courts in which Mrs Agbaje sought ancillary relief.\\nThe Nigerian court awarded her a life interest in a property in Lagos (with a capital value of about 86,000) and a lump sum equivalent to about 21,000.\\nPart III of the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984 was enacted to give the English court the power to grant financial relief after a marriage has been dissolved (or annulled) in a foreign country.\\nMrs Agbaje sought such relief.\\nThe High Court granted her leave (as required under Part III) and ultimately ordered that she should receive a lump sum equal to 65% of the sale proceeds of Lytton Road (equivalent to about 275,000) on condition that she relinquish her life interest in the Lagos property.\\nThe award represented 39% of the total assets.\\nThe Court of Appeal set aside the whole of the English award principally on the ground that the High Court had given insufficient weight to the connections of the case with Nigeria.\\nPut broadly, the overarching issue for the Supreme Court was: what is the proper approach for courts to take when considering applications made under Part III?\\nThe Supreme Court unanimously allowed the wifes appeal and restored the order of the High Court.\\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by Lord Collins.\\nThe Court held that Part III is to be applied in light of the purpose of the Act, which was the alleviation of the adverse consequences of no, or no adequate, financial provision being made by a foreign court in a situation where the parties had substantial connections with England ([71]).\\nIn applying Part III, the English courts should not be deciding whether it would be appropriate for an order to be made by a court in England or Wales as opposed to a foreign court.\\nThe whole point of Part III is to allow for relief in circumstances where there have already been proceedings in a foreign country ([50]).\\nRelevant to the question of whether an order should be made and, if so, what order, will be a number of factors such as the financial benefit which the applicant has already received, or whether the applicant has failed to take advantage of a right under the foreign law to claim financial relief.\\nThe hardship or the injustice which would result if no award were made will be relevant factors, although neither are pre conditions to an award under Part III ([41] [44] and [60] [61]).\\nAlthough there was no principle that an English court could only make an award that was the minimum necessary to remedy the injustice which would otherwise occur, it was equally not the intention of the legislation to allow a simple top up of the foreign award so as to equate with an English award in every case ([62] [65]; [72]).\\nIf the connection with England is not strong and a spouse has received adequate provision from the foreign court, it will not be appropriate for Part III to be used to top up the award.\\nIf the English connections are strong, however, it may be appropriate to do so ([70]).\\nThe amount of financial provision awarded under Part III will depend on all the circumstances of the case.\\nBut three general principles should be applied.\\nFirst, primary consideration should be given to the welfare of any child of the marriage.\\nSecond, it will never be appropriate to make an order which gives the claimant more than she or he would have been awarded had all proceedings taken place within this jurisdiction.\\nThird, where possible the order should have the result that provision is made for the reasonable needs of each spouse ([73]).\\n'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":11}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Check the average length of summary

Lord Scarman agreed (at 819) that there was need for reform. he expressed the hope that the matter would be referred to the Law Commissions. the matter was then referred to the Law Commissions. the Law Commissions recommend that the law be reformed. they recommend a filter mechanism requiring leave of the court to make an application. the law commissions also recommend a filter mechanism requiring leave of the court. the law in Northern Ireland is equivalent to Part III of the 1984 Act: SI 1989 No 677. Part III applies to annulment and judicial separation as well as to divorce. where a marriage has been dissolved, by means of judicial or other proceedings in an overseas country, the divorce is entitled to be recognised as valid in England and Wales. either party to the marriage may apply to the court in the manner prescribed by rules of court for an order for financial relief under Part III. no application for an order for financial relief shall be made under this Part of this Act unless the leave of the cousin is granted. rt has been obtained in accordance with rules of court. leave under this section may be granted notwithstanding an order made by a court in a country outside of england. d subject to such conditions as the court thinks fit. domicile in England and Wales of either party on date of application or foreign divorce. habitual residence of either party for one year ending on date of application or foreign divorce. a house in England and Wales used as a matrimonial home during the marriage. section 16 provides: the connection which the parties to the marriage have with the house. if the court is not satisfied that it would be appropriate, the court shall dismiss the application. rticular have regard to the following matters: a) the marriage was dissolved or annulled; b) the connection between those parties and the country in which the marriage was dissolved or annulled or in which they were legally separated; c) any financial benefit which the applicant or a child of the family has received, or is likely to receive, in consequence of the divorce, annulment or legal separation. d and Wales: in a case where an order has been made by a court in a (e) country outside England and Wales. order requires the other party to the marriage to make any payment or transfer any property for the benefit of the applicant or a child of the family. d and Wales: in a case where an order has been made by a court in a (e) country outside England and Wales. the length of time which has elapsed since the date of the extent to which any order made in favour of the applicant could be made. the length of time which has elapsed since the date of the extent to which any order made in favour of the applicant could be made. the court is given power to make orders under sections 23 (financial provision orders) and 24 (property adjustment orders) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. the powers of the court to make orders are more restrictive where jurisdiction depends on the matrimonial home having been in England and Wales: section 20. the court must have regard to three matters under section 17. the court is to have regard to all the circumstances of the case. the court is to have regard to the welfare while a minor of any child of the family. section 18(2) of the 1984 Act is in the same terms as section 25(1) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. section 18(2) of the 1984 Act directs attention to all the circustances. the facts The husband is aged 71, and is a barrister in Nigeria. the wife is aged 68. she lives in a house in Lytton Road, New Barnet, Hertfordshire. both parties were born in Nigeria. in the 1960s each of them came to live in england. they met in 1965 and were married in 1967. re she had met the husband and four children of the marriage, born in 1967, 1969, 1973 and 1980. all the children were born in England. in 1972 the parties acquired united kingdom citizenship and each now has dual British and Nigerian nationality. the wife says that it was a matrimonial home, and the husband says that it was purchased for the purpose of providing a home for the children (and their nanny) when they were in England. in 1999, the parties separated after 32 years of marriage. the husband issued divorce proceedings in the High Court of Lagos on June 4, 2003. the wife did not receive a copy of the husbands petition until December 10, 2003. r divorce petition on December 8, 2003 in barnet county court based on her habitual residence in England and Wales for at least one year. on February 24, 2004, the wife filed an answer and cross petition in the Lagos proceedings seeking ancillary relief. she also sought two cars, a lump sum of 10 million naira (about 42,000) as a maintenance allowance for her during hr. husband applied in England for a stay of the wifes divorce proceedings. wife made an application in Lagos for a stay of the Lagos proceedings. husband\\'s application for a stay was adjourned pending the wife\\'s application. the wife sought to withdraw her claim for ancillary relief. she gave evidence that she wanted her ancillary relief claims to be determined in London. the judge refused the wifes request that her ancillary relief claims should be determined in London. she ordered that Tin Can Island be settled on the wife for life (as the husband agreed) under the Nigerian Matrimonial Causes Act. she also ordered the husband to make a payment of a lump sue. m of 5 million naira (about 21,000) as maintenance for life. the judge dismissed the wifes claims on the basis that she had failed to prove any financial contribution towards their purchase. the delay caused by the husbands application to set aside gives rise to considerable disquiet about the procedure in Part III proceedings. the husband sought leave to apply for an order for financial relief. ed husain: a discrepancy exists between the value of matrimonial assets. husain: the provision made for the wife after a marriage of that length is modest. he says a court would consider the value of the assets to be significant. husain: the provision made for the wife after a marriage of that length is modest. there are established substantial grounds for making this application. the husband issued an application to set aside the grant of leave. the wife issued her application for periodical payments and a property adjustment order. Charles J. delivered a reserved judgment on December 18, 2006. he set out the facts and the law in the fullest detail over 28 single spaced pages. ts and what the wife was awarded. he accepted that it was not necessary to make a finding of exceptional circumstances. ts and what the wife was awarded. a property adjustment order was made in relation to the Lytton Road property. leave was made subject to a number of conditions pursuant to section 13(3). the matter was further delayed until the question of costs was dealt with. the husband applied to the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal on April 11, 2007. his application was refused on paper by Thorpe LJ, and on June 18, 2007 he renewed his application. the husband renewed his application before Wilson and Wall LJJ, who dismissed the application. the delay in appeals to the Court of Appeal and this court is shocking. the law commission recommended that the ground for leave be that the case was a proper one to be heard. the court would have an inherent power to deal with individual cases in the most convenient way. the law commission recommends that the filter should require the applicant to establish a substantial ground for the making of the application. Rule 3.17 of the Family Proceedings Rules provides for the ex parte application. Rule 3.17 provides for the ex parte application. a court may set aside an ex parte order on the application of the respondent. a further application to set aside is not specifically provided for under the Rules. concerns have been expressed at the delay caused by applications to set aside. jeffrey toobin: a proper application of the threshold of substantial ground must be done. toobin: but the word substantial is not only susceptible to ambiguity, he says. toobin: it is a word calculated to conceal a lack of precision. toobin: a proper application of the threshold of substantial ground must be done. d v Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (1979) 42 FLR 331, 348. principal object of filter mechanism is to prevent wholly unmeritorious claims. d v Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (1979) 42 FLR 331. the approach to setting aside leave should be the same as the approach to setting aside permission to appeal. in the civil procedure rules there is an express power to set aside, but which may only be exercised where there is a compelling reason to do so. in practice in the Court of Appeal the power is only exercised where some decisive authority has been overlooked so that the appeal is bound to fail. re the court has been misled: barings bank plc v Coopers & Lybrand [2002] EWCA Civ 1155; Nathan v Smilovitch [2007] EWCA Civ 759. the court should use its case management powers to adjourn an application to set aside to be heard with the substantive application. erved judgment relied on Munby Js second judgment for the chronology and the relevant law. he directed himself that he was unfettered by any hardship test. erved judgment took into account the following of the following of the following of the following. the parties had a longstanding real connection with the United Kingdom, its culture and way of life. all the children were British and were born in England. the wife had been resident in the united kingdom for nearly 10 years. th of the marriage and the needs of the wife. he ordered that the wife receive a lump sum equal to 65% of the gross proceeds of sale. the award of 275,000 represented 39% of the total assets. the Court of Appeal gave permission to appeal and allowed the appeal. the true question was whether the foreign order provided an unjust result. focus should be on whether substantial justice or injustice was done overseas. focus should be on whether the foreign court was appropriate forum for granting the divorce. coleridge: \"the focus should be on whether, objectively speaking, substantial justice or injustice was done overseas\" nnection with Nigeria. he had not addressed the need for respect and deference to be paid to the Nigerian court. nnection with Nigeria. he had not addressed the factors in section 16(2)(d),(e) and (f) aaron carroll: udgment of a foreign court was effectively what Coleridge J had done. carroll: Coleridge J relied too much on Munby Js judgment; he didn\\'t explain why case hinged on connection with england. he says no substantial injustice was done to the wife in Nigeria and justice would be done to husband. carroll: udgment of a foreign court was effectively what Coleridge J had done. the parties had a more significant connection with Nigeria than with England. the parties had a more significant connection with Nigeria than with England. the parties had a more significant connection with Nigeria than with England. tial injustice was done to the wife in Nigeria despite the absence of a power to transfer the Tin Can Island property to her. comity commanded respect for the overseas order and it would not be appropriate to grant her what Ward LJ described as even another nibble at the cherry. oleridge and the court of appeal raise a number of questions of principle. aaron carroll: the approach of the judge and the Court of Appeal does raise a number of questions. he says the approach raises a number of questions of principle which require attention. carroll: whether there were grounds for interference with the exercise of discretion is a question of principle. (2) What role (if any) forum non conveniens principles or comity have to play. (3) Whether the applicant must show exceptional circumstances, or hardship, or serious injustice. edward mccaffery: the question for determination in section 16 is whether it was appropriate. mccaffery: section 16(2) sets out matters to which court must have regard. he says part III directs court to two principal areas of fact or appreciation. mccaffery: section 16(2) sets out matters to which court must have regard. the factors in section 16(2) are not expressed to be relevant to the question whether an order is to be made. there is no ambiguity in the language, and it is there. the sidenote is Duty of the court to consider whether England and Wales is appropriate venue for application. it is intended that it should be possible to raise the issue of appropriateness of the English court separately from, or together with, matters relevant to exercise of courts discretion. the error is not likely to have any significant practical importance. by treating section 16 itself as determining criteria, the error is not likely to have any significant practical importance. the court is to have regard to all the circumstances of the case under section 16(2). for example, the financial benefit which the applicant has received. or whether the applicant has failed to take advantage of a right under foreign law to claim financial relief. edward mccaffery: cases not expressly referred to in section 16(2) may be taken into account. mccaffery: forum non conveniens and principles of comity can be taken into account. he says the doctrine of forum non conveniens is that a stumbling block is a stumbling block. mccaffery: forum non conveniens and principles of comity can be taken into account. ay of english proceedings will be granted if another forum is more appropriate. it was definitively adopted from scots law by the House of Lords. doctrine was in its infancy in england when the law commission reported. the court of appeal has drawn an analogy between the exercise in Part III and the grant of stays on the ground of forum non conveniens. for example, in Jordan v Jordan [2000] 1 W.L.R. 210, 220, a Part III case, Thorpe LJ said that de Dampierre v de Dampierre establishes the importance of fixing the primary j. urisdiction before competitive litigation in more than one jurisdiction has unnecessarily depleted available assets. it is equally important to outlaw unnecessary competitive litigation. ulex Ltd and de Dampierre v de Dampierre, to conclude substantial justice had been done in Nigeria. ulex Ltd and de Dampierre v de Dampierre, to conclude that substantial justice had been done in Nigeria. ulex Ltd and de Dampierre v de Dampierre, to conclude that substantial justice had been done. sally kohn: symmetry between rules relating to stays and anti suit injunctions and exercise of jurisdiction under section 16. kohn: it is through that prism thawed that a serious injustice had been inflicted on the wife. forum non conveniens principles were developed to deal with cases. it was necessary to decide which of two jurisdictions was appropriate. section 16 does not impose a statutory forum non conveniens test. tween jurisdictions is involved in a divorce and ancillary relief. aaron carroll: the basis of Part III is that it may be appropriate for two jurisdictions to be involved. he says it is not directed to the question of which of two jurisdictions is appropriate. carroll: it is not directed to the question of which of two jurisdictions is appropriate. little assistance can be obtained from the stay cases in the Part III exercise. the task for the judge under Part III is to determine whether an order should be made in England. the next question is whether principles of comity will add anything useful to the analysis. e factors in section 16(2) may well have been the more appropriate forum for the divorce. but in the present context it may be relevatable to the analysis. nt in three respects: comity is sometimes used in the sense of courtesy to foreign states. nt in the sense of rules of public international law which establish the proper limits of national legislative jurisdiction. nt in that sense it will be contrary to comity for uk legislation to apply in a situation involving a foreign country. there is nothing internationally objectionable in legislation which gives a court power to order financial provision notwithstanding a foreign decree of divorce. edward mccaffery: the whole point of the factors in section 16(2) is to enable the court to weigh the connections of England against the connections with the foreign jurisdiction. mccaffery: there is nothing internationally objectionable in legislation which gives court power to order financial provision notwithstanding a foreign decree of divorce. edward mccaffery: section 16 reflected the principles of comity as between competent courts. mccaffery: a court in one country should not lightly characterise the law as unjust. he says a court in another country should not characterise the law as unjust. mccaffery: comity is hardly necessary to establish that elementary principle. comity is said to be the basis for the enforcement and recognition of foreign judgments. part III allows the court to supplement the order of a foreign court. there is no obligation to recognise such orders. the order is to be regarded in England as a final judgment. it is subject to variation by the court which made it. it is not necessary to consider whether it could create issue estoppels. a warning note must be struck about the position with regard to states to which Brussels I Regulation (EC) 44/2001 on jurisdiction applies. sections 15(2) and 28(4) of the 1984 Act are subject to the Brussels I Regulation (and the Lugano Convent) a judgment in a Brussels I Regulation State making financial provision on divorce is not entitled to recognition. for purposes of the Brussels I Regulation and the Lugano Convention there is a distinction between maintenance. de Cavel v de Cavel (no 1) [1979] ECR 1055; 120/79 de Cavel v de Cavel (no 2) [1980] ECR 731] if award of maintenance had been made in another jurisdiction, question might arise. if award of maintenance had been made in another jurisdiction, question might arise. if award of maintenance had been made in another jurisdiction, question might arise. van den Boogaard v Laumen [1997] ECR I 1147, [1997] QB 759. a transfer of property may be in the nature of maintenance if it is intended to ensure the support of a spouse. a transfer of property which serves only the purpose of a division of property is not in the nature of maintenaion. nce, and concerns rights in property arising out of a matrimonial relationship. difficult questions do not arise for decision on this appeal. see also Schlosser Report on the Accession Convention. a court should be given power to entertain hard cases, the court says. the object of the discretion is to provide for the occasional hard case. the court should be given power to entertain hard cases. in an application for a financial provision or property adjustment order notwithstanding the existence of a valid foreign divorce the case would otherwise be one where serious injustice might arise. the applicant may well belong to a religious or ethnic group in which it is not u.s. there has been a tendency to regard hardship as a condition for the exercise of jurisdiction. there has been a tendency in the Family Division and in the Court of Appeal to regard it as a condition. there has been a tendency to regard hardship as a condition for the exercise of the jurisdiction. a similar tendency in the Court of Appeal to treat the element of exceptionality in the same way. it is true that at least one of the purposes of Part III is to remit hardships which have been experienced in the past. part III is to remit hardships which have been experienced in the presence of a failure in a foreign jurisdiction. jeffrey toobin: hardship is not a precondition of the exercise of the jurisdiction. toobin: parliament might have so legislated, but it did not. he says the statutory czar\\'s leave is not a precondition of the court\\'s jurisdiction. toobin: the statutory czar\\'s leave is not a precondition of the court\\'s jurisdiction. riteria: a case in which the applicant crosses the barriers contained in sections 13 and 16 is perfectly conceivable. a proposal in the Law Commission Working Paper that the court should have the power to order financial relief following a foreign divorce was not followed through. riteria: a case in which the applicant crosses the barriers without proving some specific hardship or injustice is perfectly conceivable. aaron miller: court should take into consideration hardship and injustice. miller: next question is on what basis the order for financial provision should be made. he says a court should be able to make a financial provision on the basis of hardship. miller: a court should be able to make a financial provision on the basis of injustice. court should be able to make any financial order it might have made in divorce proceedings. court should exercise its powers in accordance with guidelines laid down in section 25. in first instance, it has been held that it is only appropriably appropriably granted. there is no statutory basis for this limitation, and it is contrary to principle. there is no statutory basis for this limitation, and it is contrary to principle. a talaq entitled to recognition may be granted abroad in big money case. ost all relevant connecting factors are with england. there would be no reason not to apply english law so as to give same provision for the wife. if the wife had independent means, an enquiry into hardship would be relevant. o allow a simple top up of the foreign award so as to equate with an english award. this is apparent from a comparison of Part III with the Scottish provisions of Part IV. the application for financial relief is treated as a purely domestic application in Scottish matrimonial proceedings. the problem is to find a solution which will enable financial provision after a foreign divorce to be claimed and awarded in appropriate cases. but it will not enable it to be claimed or awarded in inappropriate cases. ate prefers a solution in which there are stricter grounds of jurisdiction. ate: a system based on rules is likely to be fairer to defenders and less objectionable. ate: a system based on rules is likely to be fairer to defenders and less objectionable. gn divorce is a new and exceptional one in our law, and we would rather proceed with caution. the court could entertain an application for an order for financial provision in Scotland after a divorce in a foreign country, if certain jurisdictional requirements and conditions were satisfied: section 28(1). the applicant was domiciled or habitually resident in Scotland on the day when the application was made. the other party to the marriage was domiciled or habitually resident in Scotland when the application was made. the other party to the marriage was domiciled or habitually resident in Scotland when the application was made. the divorce fell to be recognised in Scotland; the other party to the marriage initiated the proceedings for divorce. the application was made within 5 years after the date when the divorce took effect. a court in Scotland would have had jurisdiction to entertain an action for divorce. section 28(3) provides that both parties were living in Scotland at the time of the application. e had a substantial connection with Scotland; and both parties were living at the time of the application. section 28(3) provides that both parties were living at the time of the application. section 18 could have provided that the case was to be treated as a purely english proceeding. but it did not do so. instead a more flexible approach was deliberately adopted in Part III. there will be cases where the connection is strong and a spouse has received adequate provision from the foreign court. it will not be appropriate for Part III to be used simply as a tool to top up that provision to that which she would have received in an english divorce. there are two, inter related, duties of the court before making an order under Part III. the first is to consider whether England and Wales and Wales were connected. the second is to consider whether the court had a substantial connection with England. section 16(1) directs the court to have regard to all the circumstances of the case. section 16(2) refers the court to certain matters in particular. some matters to be considered under section 16 may be relevant under section 18. section 16(2)(e) refers the court to the financial provision made by the foreign court. section 18(6) refers the court to whether an order of a foreign court has been complied with. there is no condition of exceptionality for the purposes of section 16. there is no condition of exceptionality for the purposes of section 16. there is no condition of exceptionality for the purposes of section 16. aaron carroll: in such cases mere disparity will not trigger the application of Part III. carroll: hardship or injustice is not a condition of the exercise of the jurisdiction. he says if either factor is present, it may make it appropriate for an order to be made. carroll: if both factors are present, it may make it appropriate for an order to be made. court will not lightly characterise foreign law, or the order of a foreign court, as unjust. the amount of financial provision will depend on all the circumstances of the case. primary consideration must be given to the welfare of any children of the marriage. edward mccaffery: it will never be appropriate to make an order which gives the claimant more than she or he would have been awarded had all proceedings taken place within this jurisdiction. mccaffery: where possible the order should have the result that provision is made for the reasonable needs of each spouse. the full procedure for granting ancillary relief after an English divorce does not apply in Part III cases. the full procedure for granting ancillary relief after an English divorce does not apply in Part III cases. the full procedure for granting ancillary relief after an English divorce does not apply in Part III cases. unby J in this case, allowing jurisdiction to be tailored to the needs of the individual case. coleridge argued that there was a rule that the provision made under Part III should be the minimum required to overcome an injustice. there is no cross appeal on quantum. aaron carroll: court of appeal erred in applying traditional forum non conveniens principles. he says court erred in applying traditional forum non conveniens principles. he says court erred in applying traditional forum non conveniens principles. carroll: court of appeal erred in applying traditional forum non conveniens principles. Coleridge Js judgment was an unreserved judgment given after a 2 day hearing. a full exposition of the facts and the law in the same case by Munby J. Coleridge was fully entitled to incorporate by reference Munby Js account. what the wife received and to what she was entitled in Nigeria were obvious. what the wife received and to what she was entitled in Nigeria were obvious. what the wife received and to what she was entitled in Nigeria were obvious. the court of appeal wrongly applied traditional forum non conveniens principles. it erred in criticising Coleridge J for failing to identify which court had the closest and most appropriate connection with the parties. because the Court of Appeal wrongly applied traditional forum non conveniens principles. timothy stanley: there was a large disparity between what the wife received in Nigeria and what she would have received in England. stanley: there was a very large disparity between what the husband received and what the wife received. stanley: it was not so much that there was a very large disparity between what the husband received and what the wife received. the appeal will be allowed and the order of Coleridge J restored.']"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":12}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Load the T5 model and tokenizer\n","t5model, t5tokenizer =
